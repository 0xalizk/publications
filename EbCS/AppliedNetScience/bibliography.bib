	abstract = {In computational complexity and optimization the no free lunch theorem is a result that states that for certain types of mathematical problems, the computational cost of finding a solution, averaged over all problems in the class, is the same for any solution method. No solution therefore offers a 'short cut'. In computing, there are circumstances in which the outputs of all procedures solving a particular type of problem are statistically identical. A colourful way of describing such a circumstance, introduced by David Wolpert and William G. Macready in connection with the problems of search and optimization, is to say that there is no free lunch. Wolpert had previously derived no free lunch theorems for machine learning (statistical inference). Before Wolpert's article was published, Cullen Schaffer had summarized a preprint version of this work of Wolpert's, but used different terminology.
In the "no free lunch" metaphor, each "restaurant" (problem-solving procedure) has a "menu" associating each "lunch plate" (problem) with a "price" (the performance of the procedure in solving the problem). The menus of restaurants are identical except in one regard – the prices are shuffled from one restaurant to the next. For an omnivore who is as likely to order each plate as any other, the average cost of lunch does not depend on the choice of restaurant. But a vegan who goes to lunch regularly with a carnivore who seeks economy might pay a high average cost for lunch. To methodically reduce the average cost, one must use advance knowledge of a) what one will order and b) what the order will cost at various restaurants. That is, improvement of performance in problem-solving hinges on using prior information to match procedures to problems.
In formal terms, there is no free lunch when the probability distribution on problem instances is such that all problem solvers have identically distributed results. In the case of search, a problem instance is an objective function, and a result is a sequence of values obtained in evaluation of candidate solutions in the domain of the function. For typical interpretations of results, search is an optimization process. There is no free lunch in search if and only if the distribution on objective functions is invariant under permutation of the space of candidate solutions. This condition does not hold precisely in practice, but an "(almost) no free lunch" theorem suggests that it holds approximately.},

At the DNA level the detection of point mutations, microsatellite alterations, chromosomal alterations, i.e. inversion and deletion, and hypermethylation of promoter sequences were demonstrated.

For a simple two-state model of glycolysis, we explicitly derive analytic equations for hard trade-offs between robustness and efficiency with oscillations as an inevitable side effect. The model describes how the trade-offs arise from individual parameters, including the interplay of feedback control with autocatalysis of network products necessary to power and catalyze intermediate reactions. We then use control theory to prove that the essential features of these hard trade-off “laws” are universal and fundamental, in that they depend minimally on the details of this system and generalize to the robust efficiency of any autocatalytic network. The theory also suggests worst-case conditions that are consistent with initial experiments.

	abstract = {The combinatorial nature of many important mathematical problems, including nondeterministic-polynomial-time (NP)-complete problems, places a severe limitation on the problem size that can be solved with conventional, sequentially operating electronic computers. There have been significant efforts in conceiving parallel-computation approaches in the past, for example: DNA computation, quantum computation, and microfluidics-based computation. However, these approaches have not proven, so far, to be scalable and practical from a fabrication and operational perspective. Here, we report the foundations of an alternative parallel-computation system in which a given combinatorial problem is encoded into a graphical, modular network that is embedded in a nanofabricated planar device. Exploring the network in a parallel fashion using a large number of independent, molecular-motor-propelled agents then solves the mathematical problem. This approach uses orders of magnitude less energy than conventional computers, thus addressing issues related to power consumption and heat dissipation. We provide a proof-of-concept demonstration of such a device by solving, in a parallel fashion, the small instance \{2, 5, 9\} of the subset sum problem, which is a benchmark NP-complete problem. Finally, we discuss the technical advances necessary to make our system scalable with presently available technology.},

Under such interpretation, selection would be actively favouring the formation of modular structures, which would specialize in different functions. Here we show that, within the context of cellular networks, no such selection pressure is needed to obtain modularity. Instead, the intrinsic dynamics of network growth by duplication and diversification is able to generate it for free and explain the statistical features exhibited by small subgraphs. The implications for the evolution and evolvability of both biological and technological systems are discussed.},

	abstract = {The resilient, ancient, and fine-tuned DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) has inspired many
researchers to harness its power for material purposes. In this work, we use synthesized DNA
strands to compute the solution to an instance of edge-matching puzzles (EMP), where the
challenge is to pack a collection of edge-coloured square tiles on a square board such that all
adjacent edges match in colour. We encode tiles with DNA strands and make use of structural,
chemical and enzymatic properties of DNA to effectively carry out a brute-force search of the
solution to the puzzle. The solution ultimately results as a 2-dimensional DNA lattice encoding
the position and orientation of each tile on the solution board. Our approach has been to
represent a tile as the union of two half-tiles. This conceptual representation allows for the use
of a supremely powerful heuristic: polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can be inserted at
any step of the protocol to selectively amplify certain strands to exponential quantities. Our
abstract formalization of half-tiles and the DNA protocol we use to manipulate them have
relevance in three ways. First, by solving an instance of the (NP-Complete) EMP problem we
make precise characterizations of the processing power of DNA Computing. Second, the 2-
dimensional self-assembly of half-tiles is Turing-complete.
Thirdly, the 2-dimensional self-
assembly of half-tiles can serve as a PCR-powered model for massive nano-scale fabrication of 2-
dimensional DNA nano-shapes.},

However, we show that these ideals are highly over-optimistic, and suggest that standard algorithm-choice scenarios will rarely lead to the best algorithm for individual instances in the space of interest. We do this by examining algorithm ‘footprints’, indicating how performance generalises in instance space. We find much evidence that typical ways of choosing the ‘best’ algorithm, via tests over a distribution of instances, are seriously flawed. Also, understanding how footprints in instance spaces vary between algorithms and across instance space dimensions, may lead to a future platform for wiser algorithm-choice decisions.},

Understanding how complex phenotypes arise from individual molecules and their interactions is a primary challenge in biology that computational approaches are poised to tackle. We report a whole-cell computational model of the life cycle of the human pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium that includes all of its molecular components and their interactions. An integrative approach to modeling that combines diverse mathematics enabled the simultaneous inclusion of fundamentally different cellular processes and experimental measurements. Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions.

	abstract = {Computational modeling of biological systems is becoming increasingly important in efforts to better understand complex biological behaviors. In this review, we distinguish between two types of biological models—mathematical and computational—which differ in their representations of biological phenomena. We call the approach of constructing computational models of biological systems 'executable biology', as it focuses on the design of executable computer algorithms that mimic biological phenomena. We survey the main modeling efforts in this direction, emphasize the applicability and benefits of executable models in biological research and highlight some of the challenges that executable biology poses for biology and computer science. We claim that for executable biology to reach its full potential as a mainstream biological technique, formal and algorithmic approaches must be integrated into biological research. This will drive biology toward a more precise engineering discipline.},

This dataset represents interaction records for 66 model organisms and represents a 30\% increase compared to the previous 2015 BioGRID update. BioGRID curates the biomedical literature for major model organism species, including humans, with a recent emphasis on central biological processes and specific human diseases. To facilitate network-based approaches to drug discovery, BioGRID now incorporates 27 501 chemical–protein interactions for human drug targets, as drawn from the DrugBank database. A new dynamic interaction network viewer allows the easy navigation and filtering of all genetic and protein interaction data, as well as for bioactive compounds and their established targets.

Despite the existence of precise mathematical formulations of the mechanisms of sexual evolution dating back to the work of Fisher, Haldane, and Wright [1] in the beginning of the twentieth century, the exact nature of the relationship between evolution and diversity has still not been fully fleshed out. 



Recently, computer scientists have focused on this challenge in the hope of providing a fresh perspective to century old questions. 






Chastain et al. [4, 5] have explored connections between sexual evolution in hap- loid species1 and behavioral dynamics in coordination games. These dynamics belong to the family of replicator dynamics2, which is known to be closely related to the multiplicative weights update algorithm (MWUA) [24].

	abstract = {In graph theory, a dominating set for a graph G = (V, E) is a subset D of V such that every vertex not in D is adjacent to at least one member of D. The domination number γ(G) is the number of vertices in a smallest dominating set for G.
The dominating set problem concerns testing whether γ(G) ≤ K for a given graph G and input K; it is a classical NP-complete decision problem in computational complexity theory (Garey \& Johnson 1979). Therefore it is believed that there is no efficient algorithm that finds a smallest dominating set for a given graph.
Figures (a)–(c) on the right show three examples of dominating sets for a graph. In each example, each white vertex is adjacent to at least one red vertex, and it is said that the white vertex is dominated by the red vertex. The domination number of this graph is 2: the examples (b) and (c) show that there is a dominating set with 2 vertices, and it can be checked that there is no dominating set with only 1 vertex for this graph.},

	abstract = {The Matthew effect describes the phenomenon that in societies, the rich tend to get richer and the potent even more powerful. It is closely related to the concept of preferential attachment in network science, where the more connected nodes are destined to acquire many more links in the future than the auxiliary nodes. Cumulative advantage and success-breads-success also both describe the fact that advantage tends to beget further advantage. The concept is behind the many power laws and scaling behaviour in empirical data, and it is at the heart of self-organization across social and natural sciences. Here, we review the methodology for measuring preferential attachment in empirical data, as well as the observations of the Matthew effect in patterns of scientific collaboration, socio-technical and biological networks, the propagation of citations, the emergence of scientific progress and impact, career longevity, the evolution of common English words and phrases, as well as in education and brain development. We also discuss whether the Matthew effect is due to chance or optimization, for example related to homophily in social systems or efficacy in technological systems, and we outline possible directions for future research.},

	abstract = {The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a powerful method for amplification of DNA segments between two regions of known sequences (1, 2). In standard PCR, sequences bound by two unique oligonucleotide primers can be exponentially amplified. However, it is a prerequisite to know the DNA sequence at both ends of the region of interest. To amplify regions of unknown sequence, methods such as inverted PCR (3), Alu PCR (4), and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (5), also known as anchored PCR (6) or one‐sided PCR (7), have been developed. These methods require several enzymatic manipulations of DNA that are either tedious or only suitable for certain conditions. While using standard PCR for in vitro amplification of 5′ untranslated cDNA sequence of acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) mRNA, we observed amplification of a second specific fragment in addition to the expected fragment. Sequence analysis showed that the additional fragment resulted from binding of the 5′ primer to a region that has an imperfect match to the actual primer binding site. Comparing the sequences of the primer (HBGF 1201) and the binding site revealed that only eight out of 32 nucleotides matched (Fig. 1A). Those eight nucleotides cluster in the 19 nucleotides at the 3′ end of the primer and therefore provided priming that allowed for a specific amplified product. With this observation, we reasoned that a single primer could be used, binding both to the complementary sequence},

	abstract = {Expression of the Drosophila segment polarity genes is initiated by a pre-pattern of pair-rule gene products and maintained by a network of regulatory interactions throughout several stages of embryonic development. Analysis of a model of gene interactions based on differential equations showed that wild-type expression patterns of these genes can be obtained for a wide range of kinetic parameters, which suggests that the steady states are determined by the topology of the network and the type of regulatory interactions between components, not the detailed form of the rate laws. To investigate this, we propose and analyse a Boolean model of this network which is based on a binary ON/OFF representation of mRNA and protein levels, and in which the interactions are formulated as logical functions. In this model the spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression are determined by the topology of the network and whether components are present or absent, rather than the absolute levels of the mRNAs and proteins and the functional details of their interactions. The model is able to reproduce the wild-type gene expression patterns, as well as the ectopic expression patterns observed in overexpression experiments and various mutants. Furthermore, we compute explicitly all steady states of the network and identify the basin of attraction of each steady state. The model gives important insights into the functioning of the segment polarity gene network, such as the crucial role of the wingless and sloppy paired genes, and the network's ability to correct errors in the pre-pattern.},

Moreover, it can shed light on disease mechanisms via the identification of modules perturbed in those diseases. Current challenges include understanding disease as a result of the interplay between environmental and genetic perturbations and assessing the impact of personal sequence variations in the context of networks.

This network contains 94 proteins, almost all of which bind to other proteins in the network. To understand the functions of large protein collections such as these, it will be necessary to move away from one-by-one analysis of individual proteins and create computational models of entire networks. This will allow classification of networks into categories and permit researchers to identify key network proteins on theoretical grounds. We show here that the fat regulation network fits a Watts-Strogatz small-world model. This model was devised to explain the clustering phenomena often observed in real networks, but has not been previously applied to signaling networks within cells. The short path length and high clustering coefficients characteristic of the Watts-Strogatz topology allow for rapid communication between distant nodes and for division of the network into modules that perform different functions. The fat regulation network has modules, and it is divisible into subnetworks that span modular boundaries and regulate different aspects of fat metabolism. We experimentally examined communication between nodes within the network using a combination of genetics and pharmacology, and showed that the communication patterns are consistent with the Watts-Strogatz topology.},

	abstract = {Summary
Many signaling systems show adaptation—the ability to reset themselves after responding to a stimulus. We computationally searched all possible three-node enzyme network topologies to identify those that could perform adaptation. Only two major core topologies emerge as robust solutions: a negative feedback loop with a buffering node and an incoherent feedforward loop with a proportioner node. Minimal circuits containing these topologies are, within proper regions of parameter space, sufficient to achieve adaptation. More complex circuits that robustly perform adaptation all contain at least one of these topologies at their core. This analysis yields a design table highlighting a finite set of adaptive circuits. Despite the diversity of possible biochemical networks, it may be common to find that only a finite set of core topologies can execute a particular function. These design rules provide a framework for functionally classifying complex natural networks and a manual for engineering networks.

The ‘Approximate Majority’ computational algorithm provides the asymptotically fastest way to reach a common decision by all members of a population between two possible outcomes, where the decision approximately matches the initial relative majority. The network that regulates the mitotic entry of the cell-cycle in eukaryotes also makes a decision before it induces early mitotic processes. Here we show that the switch from inactive to active forms of the mitosis promoting Cyclin Dependent Kinases is driven by a system that is related to both the structure and the dynamics of the Approximate Majority computation. We investigate the behavior of these two switches by deterministic, stochastic and probabilistic methods and show that the steady states and temporal dynamics of the two systems are similar and they are exchangeable as components of oscillatory networks.},

Until recently such cognitive learning seemed irrelevant to the ‘uninformed’ process of evolution. In our opinion, however, new results formally linking evolutionary processes to the principles of learning might provide solutions to several evolutionary puzzles – the evolution of evolvability, the evolution of ecological organisation, and evolutionary transitions in individuality. If so, the ability for evolution to learn might explain how it produces such apparently intelligent designs.},

Second, it contrasts the predominant perspective in the network science literature (that abstracts away domain-specific function and instead focuses on graph-theoretic measures of system structure and dynamics) with that of engineers and practitioners of decision science (who emphasize the importance of network performance, constraints, and trade-offs). Third, it proposes optimization-based reverse engineering to address some important open questions within network science from an operations research perspective.

	abstract = {Many complex systems display a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. For example, relatively simple organisms grow, persist and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions, an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic network. Complex communication networks display a surprising degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. Here we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks, which include the World-Wide Web, the Internet, social networks and cells. We find that such networks display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected even by unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity). Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties of communication networks.},

	abstract = {The capacity of cells and organisms to respond to challenging conditions in a repeatable manner is limited by a finite repertoire of pre-evolved adaptive responses. Beyond this capacity, cells can use exploratory dynamics to cope with a much broader array of conditions. However, the process of adaptation by exploratory dynamics within the lifetime of a cell is not well understood. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of exploratory adaptation in a high-dimensional network model of gene regulation. Exploration is initiated by failure to comply with a constraint and is implemented by random sampling of network configurations. It ceases if and when the network reaches a stable state satisfying the constraint. We find that successful convergence (adaptation) in high dimensions requires outgoing network hubs and is enhanced by their auto-regulation. The ability of these empirically validated features of gene regulatory networks to support exploratory adaptation without fine-tuning, makes it plausible for biological implementation., Recent works suggest that cellular networks may respond to novel challenges on the time-scale of cellular lifetimes through large-scale perturbation of gene expression and convergence to a new state. Here, the authors demonstrate the theoretical feasibility of exploratory adaptation in cellular networks by showing that convergence to new states depends on known features of these networks.},

	abstract = {Modularity is a central concept in modern biology, providing a powerful framework for the study of living organisms on many organizational levels. Two central and related questions can be posed in regard to modularity: How does modularity appear in the first place, and what forces are responsible for keeping and/or changing modular patterns? We approached these questions using a quantitative genetics simulation framework, building on previous results obtained with bivariate systems and extending them to multivariate systems. We developed an individual-based model capable of simulating many traits controlled by many loci with variable pleiotropic relations between them, expressed in populations subject to mutation, recombination, drift, and selection. We used this model to study the problem of the emergence of modularity, and hereby show that drift and stabilizing selection are inefficient at creating modular variational structures. We also demonstrate that directional selection can have marked effects on the modular structure between traits, actively promoting a restructuring of genetic variation in the selected population and potentially facilitating the response to selection. Furthermore, we give examples of complex covariation created by simple regimes of combined directional and stabilizing selection and show that stabilizing selection is important in the maintenance of established covariation patterns. Our results are in full agreement with previous results for two-trait systems and further extend them to include scenarios of greater complexity. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary consequences of modular patterns being molded by directional selection.},

	abstract = {The spectral gap—the energy difference between the ground state and first excited state of a system—is central to quantum many-body physics. Many challenging open problems, such as the Haldane conjecture, the question of the existence of gapped topological spin liquid phases, and the Yang–Mills gap conjecture, concern spectral gaps. These and other problems are particular cases of the general spectral gap problem: given the Hamiltonian of a quantum many-body system, is it gapped or gapless? Here we prove that this is an undecidable problem. Specifically, we construct families of quantum spin systems on a two-dimensional lattice with translationally invariant, nearest-neighbour interactions, for which the spectral gap problem is undecidable. This result extends to undecidability of other low-energy properties, such as the existence of algebraically decaying ground-state correlations. The proof combines Hamiltonian complexity techniques with aperiodic tilings, to construct a Hamiltonian whose ground state encodes the evolution of a quantum phase-estimation algorithm followed by a universal Turing machine. The spectral gap depends on the outcome of the corresponding ‘halting problem’. Our result implies that there exists no algorithm to determine whether an arbitrary model is gapped or gapless, and that there exist models for which the presence or absence of a spectral gap is independent of the axioms of mathematics.

This question has been raised before and resolved in favour of 3/4. Like previous ones, recent claims for a value of 2/3 are based almost entirely on basal metabolic rate (BMR) in mammals.
* 2Here we compile and analyse a new, larger data set for mammalian BMR. We show that interspecific variation in BMR, as well as field metabolic rates of mammals, and basal or standard metabolic rates for many other organisms, including vertebrates, invertebrates, protists and plants, all scale with exponents whose confidence intervals include 3/4 and exclude 2/3. Our analysis of maximal metabolic rate gives a slope that is greater than and confidence intervals that exclude both 3/4 and 2/3.

Renewed interest in allometry is due at least in part to recent theories that purport to explain the quarter-power scaling (West, Brown \& Enquist 1997, 1999a; Banavar, Maritan \& Rinaldo 1999; Banavar et al. 2002). These theories derive the scaling for metabolic rate based on the designs of resource distribution networks, such as animal and plant vascular systems. In particular, the model of West et al. assumes that these networks have three properties: (1) they branch hierarchically to supply all parts of three dimensional organisms; (2) they have terminal units, such as capillaries or petioles, that do not vary with body size; and (3) natural selection has optimized hydrodynamic flow through the network so that the work required to distribute resources has been minimized. This model predicts many other characteristics of plant and animal circulatory systems, including dimensions of vessels, total volume of fluid, rates of flow and delivery times. This model has been extended to explain the quarter-power scaling of many biological traits, including mitochondrial densities (West, Woodruff \& Brown 2002), ontogenetic growth rates (West, Brown \& Enquist 2001), the partitioning and allocation of production between plant organs such as roots, stems, leaves, and reproductive structures (Enquist \& Niklas 2002; Niklas \& Enquist 2002), times of life-history events (Gillooly et al. 2002; Savage et al. 2004), and population growth rates (Savage et al. 2004).},

We argue that progress in understanding the processes of network evolution is only possible when hypotheses are formulated as plausible evolutionary models and compared against the observed data within the framework of probabilistic modeling. The value of such models is expected to be greatly enhanced as they incorporate more of the details of the biophysical properties of interacting proteins, gene phylogeny, and measurement error and as more advanced methodologies emerge for model comparison and the inference of ancestral network states.},

	abstract = {In any given cell, thousands of genes are expressed and work in concert to ensure the cell's function, fitness, and survival. Each gene, in turn, must be expressed at the proper time and in the proper amounts to ensure the appropriate functional outcome. The regulation and expression of some genes are highly robust; their expression is controlled by invariable expression programs. For instance, developmental gene expression is extremely similar in a given cell type from one individual to another. The expression of other genes is more variable: Their levels are noisy and are different from cell to cell and from individual to individual. This can be highly beneficial in physiological responses to outside cues and stresses. Recent advances have enabled the analysis of differential gene expression at a systems level. Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) involving interactions between large numbers of genes and their regulators have been mapped onto graphic diagrams that are used to visualize the regulatory relationships. The further characterization of GRNs has already uncovered global principles of gene regulation. Together with synthetic network biology, such studies are starting to provide insights into the transcriptional mechanisms that cause robust versus stochastic gene expression and their relationships to phenotypic robustness and variability. Here, we discuss GRNs and their topological properties in relation to transcriptional and phenotypic outputs in development and organismal physiology.},

	abstract = {Dynamic programming is one of the fundamental techniques for solving optimization problems. In this paper we propose a general framework which can be used to decrease the time and space complexity of these algorithms with a logarithmic factor. The framework is based on word encoding, i.e. by representing subsolutions as bits in an integer. In this way word parallelism can be used in the evaluation of the dynamic programming recursion. Using this encoding the subset-sum problem can be solved in O( n b/ log b) time and O(b/ log b) space, where n is the number of integers given and b is the target sum. The knapsack problem can be solved in O( n m/ log m) time and O(m/ log m) space, where n is the number of items and m = max\{b,z\} is the maximum of the capacity b and the optimal solution value z . The problem of finding a path of a given length b in a directed acyclic graph G=(V,E) can be solved in O({\textbar}E{\textbar}b/ log b) time and O({\textbar}V{\textbar}b/ log b) space. Several other examples are given showing the generality of the achieved technique. Extensive computational experiments are provided to demonstrate that the achieved results are not only of theoretical interest but actually lead to algorithms which are up to two orders of magnitude faster than their predecessors. This is a surprising observation as the increase in speed is larger than the word size of the processor.},

Recycling happens when a product of one reaction is a reactant in a later reaction. Recycling has the benefits of reducing consumption, or waste, of molecules and of avoiding fuel depletion. We present a binary counter that recycles molecules efficiently while incurring just a moderate slowdown compared with alternative counters that do not recycle strands. This counter is an n-bit binary reflecting Gray code counter that advances through 2n states. In the strand displacement realization of this counter, the waste—total number of nucleotides of the DNA strands consumed—is polynomial in n, the number of bits of the counter, while the waste of alternative counters grows exponentially in n. We also show that our n-bit counter fails to work correctly when many (Θ(n)) copies of the species that represent the bits of the counter are present initially. The proof applies more generally to show that in chemical reaction systems where all but one reactant of each reaction are catalysts, computations longer than a polynomial function of the size of the system are not possible when there are polynomially many copies of the system present.},

While alternative splicing is known to diversify the functional characteristics of some genes, the extent to which protein isoforms globally contribute to functional complexity on a proteomic scale remains unknown. To address this systematically, we cloned full-length open reading frames of alternatively spliced transcripts for a large number of human genes and used protein-protein interaction profiling to functionally compare hundreds of protein isoform pairs. The majority of isoform pairs share less than 50\% of their interactions. In the global context of interactome network maps, alternative isoforms tend to behave like distinct proteins rather than minor variants of each other. Interaction partners specific to alternative isoforms tend to be expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner and belong to distinct functional modules. Our strategy, applicable to other functional characteristics, reveals a widespread expansion of protein interaction capabilities through alternative splicing and suggests that many alternative “isoforms” are functionally divergent (i.e., “functional alloforms”).},

This should affect hubs.The network information is in Table S2B.This is from the text:
"First we performed yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens in which all protein isoforms, fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (DB),were tested against proteins encoded by the hORFeome v5.1 collection of ∼15,000 ORF clones fused to the Gal4 activation domain(AD) (Dreze et al., 2010, Rolland et al., 2014 and Rual et al., 2005). Following first-pass screening, each protein isoform waspairwise tested for interaction with the candidate partners identified not only for itself but also for all first-pass partners of all other protein isoforms encoded by the same gene, thus minimizing biases due to incomplete sampling sensitivity (Venkatesan et al., 2009). To generate a final dataset of verified Y2H pairs, pairs showing a positive result in at least two out of the three pairwise tests were subjected to a fourth pairwise retest, and PCR products amplified from the final positive pairs were sequenced to confirm the identity of clones encoding each interacting protein (Figure 2A and Table S2B). Western blots were performed for all protein isoforms of a subset of randomly picked genes, demonstrating comparable heterologous protein expression of all isoforms of the same gene tested by Y2H (Figures 2B and S2A–S2H). Finally, to validate the overall quality of the PPI dataset of human protein pairs identified by Y2H, we selected a representative sample of the isoform-partner interacting and non-interacting pairs and subjected them to orthogonal validation in human HEK293T cells using a protein complementation assay (PCA) (Dreze et al., 2010 and Rolland et al., 2014) (Figure 2C; Table S2C). The isoform-partner positive pairs were recovered at a rate similar to that seen for pairs from a well-described positive reference set (PRS) (Venkatesan et al., 2009), while isoform-partner negative pairs validated at a rate similar to that seen for pairs from a random reference set (RRS) (Figure 2C and Tables S2C and S2D)."},

Using this machinery, we study the role of mutation in changing environments in the presence of sexual reproduction. Following [WVA05], we model changing environments via a Markov chain, with the states representing environments, each with its own fitness matrix. In this setting, we show that in the absence of mutation, the population goes extinct, but in the presence of mutation, the population survives with positive probability. On the way to proving the above theorem, we need to establish some facts about dynamics in games. We provide the first, to our knowledge, polynomial convergence bound for noisy MWU in a coordination game. Finally, we also show that in static environments, sexual evolution with mutation converges, for any level of mutation.},

	abstract = {How does new genetic information arise? Traditional thinking holds that mutation happens by accident and then spreads in the population by either natural selection or random genetic drift. There have been at least two fundamental conceptual problems with imagining an alternative. First, it seemed that the only alternative is a mutation that responds “smartly” to the immediate environment; but in complex multicellulars, it is hard to imagine how this could be implemented. Second, if there were mechanisms of mutation that “knew” what genetic changes would be favored in a given environment, this would have only begged the question of how they acquired that particular knowledge to begin with. This paper offers an alternative that avoids these problems. It holds that mutational mechanisms act on information that is in the genome, based on considerations of simplicity, parsimony, elegance, etc. (which are different than fitness considerations). This simplification process, under the performance pressure exerted by selection, not only leads to the improvement of adaptations but also creates elements that have the capacity to serve in new contexts they were not originally selected for. Novelty, then, arises at the system level from emergent interactions between such elements. Thus, mechanistically driven mutation neither requires Lamarckian transmission nor closes the door on novelty, because the changes it implements interact with one another globally in surprising and beneficial ways. Finally, I argue, for example, that genes used together are fused together; that simplification leads to complexity; and that evolution and learning are conceptually linked.},

"either mutation is accidental at the core, or it is Lamarckian, responding in some “smart” way to the immediate environment.
..... The purpose of this paper is to propose a third alternative. In this third alternative, selection in the sense of differential survival and reproduction is still the force that provides feedback on the fit between the organism and its environment. However, mutation is neither Lamarckian nor accidental. Instead, mutational mechanisms act on information that is in the genome as though by considerations of simplicity, parsimony, elegance, etc. (which are different than fitness considerations).....
..... In this paper, I will discuss various observations in support of this idea....
..... it will agree with that literature on the fact that network-level (or system-level) evolution is responsible for the evolution of novelty at both the phenotypic"

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon, (popularly known as six degrees of separation). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

	abstract = {Presents statistical analyses of the search-space landscape of knapsack problems in due consideration of stochastic optimization. It is known from existing works that travelling salesman problems have a rugged landscape. We deal with 1000 knapsack problems where the values and the weights of the objects are arranged randomly. By introducing proper estimate values and topology, it is revealed that the landscape of these knapsack problems is a rugged landscape similar to that of the travelling salesman problems. It is assumed that the rugged landscape is a combination of a global valley-like structure and a local noise-like structure. We propose a new algorithm to estimate the optimum point by introducing the least mean square method to fit the global structure at some points selected randomly in the search space. The method does not contradict “no free lunch” theorems because of the availing features of the landscape. It is forecast that not only knapsack problems but also many practical problems have a structure which is characterized with the same measure. These results are useful in order to compose more effective optimization methods without a trial-and-error process},

	shorttitle = {No simple dependence between protein evolution rate and the number of protein-protein interactions},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that rates of protein evolution are influenced, to a great extent, by the proportion of amino acid residues that are directly involved in protein function. In agreement with this hypothesis, recent work has shown a negative correlation between evolutionary rates and the number of protein-protein interactions. However, the extent to which the number of protein-protein interactions influences evolutionary rates remains unclear. Here, we address this question at several different levels of evolutionary relatedness.
RESULTS: Manually curated data on the number of protein-protein interactions among Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins was examined for possible correlation with evolutionary rates between S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe orthologs. Only a very weak negative correlation between the number of interactions and evolutionary rate of a protein was observed. Furthermore, no relationship was found between a more general measure of the evolutionary conservation of S. cerevisiae proteins, based on the taxonomic distribution of their homologs, and the number of protein-protein interactions. However, when the proteins from yeast were assorted into discrete bins according to the number of interactions, it turned out that 6.5\% of the proteins with the greatest number of interactions evolved, on average, significantly slower than the rest of the proteins. Comparisons were also performed using protein-protein interaction data obtained with high-throughput analysis of Helicobacter pylori proteins. No convincing relationship between the number of protein-protein interactions and evolutionary rates was detected, either for comparisons of orthologs from two completely sequenced H. pylori strains or for comparisons of H. pylori and Campylobacter jejuni orthologs, even when the proteins were classified into bins by the number of interactions.
CONCLUSION: The currently available comparative-genomic data do not support the hypothesis that the evolutionary rates of the majority of proteins substantially depend on the number of protein-protein interactions they are involved in. However, a small fraction of yeast proteins with the largest number of interactions (the hubs of the interaction network) tend to evolve slower than the bulk of the proteins.},

Through design and evolution, HOT systems achieve rare structured states which are robust to perturbations they were designed to handle, yet fragile to unexpected pertur- bations and design flaws. As the sophistication of these systems is increased, engineers encounter a series of trade- offs between greater productivity or throughput and the possibility of catastrophic failure. Such robustness trade- offs are central properties of the complex systems which arise in biology and engineering. They also distinguish HOT states from the generic ensembles typically studied in statistical physics in the context of the “edge of chaos” (EOC) [2] and self-organized criticality (SOC) [3].

Hence, the fact that it may break down highly favorable genetic combinations has been seen as a problem. Here, we consider an alternative approach. We define a measure that represents the ability of alleles to perform well across different combinations and, using numerical iterations within a classical population-genetic framework, show that selection in the presence of sex favors this ability in a highly robust manner. We also show that the mechanism responsible for this effect has been out of the purview of previous theory, because it operates during the evolutionary transient, and that the breaking down of favorable genetic combinations is an integral part of it. Implications of these results and more to evolutionary theory are discussed.},

Using the two methods to shuffle the neuronal network in systematic ways, the edge exchange and the vertex swapping, we show that positions of neurons are not randomly distributed but organized to reduce the wiring cost. Furthermore, we discuss the trade-off between the wiring cost and the performance of the network.},

	abstract = {Author Summary The number of personal genomes sequenced has grown rapidly over the last few years and is likely to grow further. In order to use the DNA sequence variants amongst individuals for personalized medicine, we need to understand the functional impact of these variants. Deleterious variants in genes can have a wide spectrum of global effects, ranging from fatal for essential genes to no obvious damaging effect for loss-of-function tolerant genes. The global effect of a gene mutation is largely governed by the diverse biological networks in which the gene participates. Since genes participate in many networks, no singular network captures the global picture of gene interactions. Here we integrate the diverse modes of gene interactions (regulatory, genetic, phosphorylation, signaling, metabolic and physical protein-protein interactions) to create a unified biological network. We then exploit the unique properties of loss-of-function tolerant and essential genes in this unified network to build a computational model that can predict global perturbation caused by deleterious mutations in all genes. Our model can distinguish between these two gene sets with high accuracy and we further show that it can be used for interpretation of variants involved in Mendelian diseases and in complex disorders probed by genome-wide association studies.},

"(the “new sciences” of) complexity that is in direct conflict with Turing’s insights and the attention to these unrewarding views of complexity has distracted many fields from appreciating Turing’s work."
 


"These [UTM,Halting] are arguably the most important theoretical results on universal laws and architectures, and could be the origin for a general theory of laws and architectures."
 
"There is another important sense in which this is an inversion of conventional thinking, and that is with regard to biology. The conventional view is that there are no new fundamental laws and principles in biology that aren’t derivable from chemistry and in turn physics."
 
"I will argue, perhaps only tentatively here, that quite the opposite is true, and that biology is full of new laws and principles that seem completely independent of physics. The TM, UTM, and (un)decidability exemplify the existence of universal laws and architectures that appear largely independent of physics."
"The other extreme is statistical physics and its application to complex systems (SPCS), where the gaps are assumed to be so small that they can be covered by largely random ensembles and minimal tuning, as exemplified by such concepts and theories as “order for free, edge of chaos, self-organized criticality (SOC), scale-free networks” etc etc."
"So the thing that appears easiest to measure, low level neural connectivity, or high level fMRI correlations, are almost certainly the least informative about what is most essential to how brain makes mind"
"Instead it is the layering itself and the protocols that are universal and thus constrained that are the essence of architecture."
"The dominance of mainstream “complexity” thinking by SPCS “order for free, edge of chaos, self-organized criticality (SOC), scale-free networks” despite how utterly wrong it has been continues to need addressing and again maybe Turing can help."

Prior research into network theory and its application to software systems has found evidence that many important properties in real software systems exhibit approximately scale-free structure, including coupling; researchers have claimed that such scale-free structures are ubiquitous. This implies that high coupling must be unavoidable, statistically speaking, apparently contradicting standard ideas about software structure. We present a model that leads to the simple predictions that approximately scale-free structures ought to arise both for between-module connectivity and overall connectivity, and not as the result of poor design or optimization shortcuts. These predictions are borne out by our large-scale empirical study. Hence we conclude that high coupling is not avoidable—and that this is in fact quite reasonable.},

The formalism covers a broad range of steady-state dynamical processes and offers testable predictions regarding the system’s response to perturbations and the development of correlations. It predicts several distinct universality classes whose characteristics can be derived directly from the continuum equation governing the system’s dynamics and which are validated on several canonical network-based dynamical systems, from biochemical dynamics to epidemic spreading. Finally, we collect experimental data pertaining to social and biological systems, demonstrating that we can accurately uncover their universality class even in the absence of an appropriate continuum theory that governs the system’s dynamics.},

They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list—reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the “tumor microenvironment.” Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

	abstract = {High-throughput screens have begun to reveal the protein interaction network that underpins most cellular functions in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. How the organization of this network affects the evolution of the proteins that compose it is a fundamental question in molecular evolution. We show that the connectivity of well-conserved proteins in the network is negatively correlated with their rate of evolution. Proteins with more interactors evolve more slowly not because they are more important to the organism, but because a greater proportion of the protein is directly involved in its function. At sites important for interaction between proteins, evolutionary changes may occur largely by coevolution, in which substitutions in one protein result in selection pressure for reciprocal changes in interacting partners. We confirm one predicted outcome of this process—namely, that interacting proteins evolve at similar rates.},

Myc is known to directly upregulate a pro-tumorigenic group of microRNAs (miRNAs) known as the miR-17–92 cluster. Through the analysis of human and mouse models of B cell lymphoma, we show here that Myc regulates a much broader set of miRNAs than previously anticipated. Unexpectedly, the predominant consequence of activation of Myc is widespread repression of miRNA expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals that much of this repression is likely to be a direct result of Myc binding to miRNA promoters. We further show that enforced expression of repressed miRNAs diminishes the tumorigenic potential of lymphoma cells. These results demonstrate that extensive reprogramming of the miRNA transcriptome by Myc contributes to tumorigenesis.},

We suppose that a link with another agent allows access, in part and in due course, to the benefits available to the latter via his own links. Thus individual links generate externalities whose value depends on the level of decay/delay associated with indirect links. A distinctive aspect of our approach is that the costs of link formation are incurred only by the person who initiates the link. This allows us to formulate the network formation process as a noncooperative game. We first provide a characterization of the architecture of equilibrium networks. We then study the dynamics of network formation. We find that individual efforts to access benefits offered by others lead, rapidly, to the emergence of an equilibrium social network, under a variety of circumstances. The limiting networks have simple architectures, e.g., the wheel, the star, or generalizations of these networks. In many cases, such networks are also socially efficient.},

Moreover, we consider a generalized version of this preferential attachment model with independent saturation and viability, leading to a broader class of power laws again with exponential cutoff. We present a collection of empirical observations from social, biological, physical, and technological networks, for which such degree distributions give excellent fits. We suggest that, in general, optimization models that give rise to preferential attachment with saturation and viability effects form a good starting point for the analysis of many networks.},

A method whereby a nucleic acid sequence can be exponentially amplified in vitro is described in the chapter. The same method can be used to alter the amplified sequence or to append new sequence information to it. It is necessary that the ends of the sequence be known in sufficient detail that oligonucleotides can be synthesized, which will hybridize to them and that a small amount of the sequence be available to initiate the reaction. The oligonucleotides are complementary to different strands of the desired sequence and at relative positions along the sequence such that the DNA polymerase extension product of the one, when denatured, can serve as a template for the other and vice versa. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using an automated DNA synthesis machine (Biosearch, Inc., San Rafael, California) using phosphoramidite chemistry. “Mispriming"” can be usefully employed to make intentional in vitro mutations or to add sequence information to one or both ends of a given sequence. The chapter explores the possibility of utilizing a heat-stable DNA polymerase so as to avoid the need for addition of new enzyme after each cycle of thermal denaturation},

In addition, scientists are increasingly realizing that biological systems, even the simplest ones, are extraordinarily complex. Generally, biology suffers from a lack of theoretical frameworks that could integrate both complexity and the amount of data so as to orient future research. In an attempt to address this problem, Nobel laureate Sydney Brenner argued that Turing machines have much in common with cells and living organisms; that cells and living organisms are, in fact, the best examples of Turing's and von Neumann's machines [[1]]. This is not a new concept; Brenner's comment is just the latest one among many others who have tried to explain the behaviour and abilities of living systems by comparing these to machines or computers.

However, we think that this analogy between cells and machines is misguided. It has not, and will not, contribute to our understanding of biological systems. In our opinion, such a mechanistic, bottom‐up doctrine does not explain the true living nature of organisms as it ignores the top‐down, context‐dependent and agent‐based aspects of living nature [[2], [3], [4], [5], [6]].

Although a sophisticated set of measures is available to describe the topology of brain networks, the selection pressures that drive their formation remain largely unknown. Here we consider generative models for the probability of a functional connection (an edge) between two cortical regions (nodes) separated by some Euclidean distance in anatomical space. In particular, we propose a model in which the embedded topology of brain networks emerges from two competing factors: a distance penalty based on the cost of maintaining long-range connections; and a topological term that favors links between regions sharing similar input. We show that, together, these two biologically plausible factors are sufficient to capture an impressive range of topological properties of functional brain networks. Model parameters estimated in one set of functional MRI (fMRI) data on normal volunteers provided a good fit to networks estimated in a second independent sample of fMRI data. Furthermore, slightly detuned model parameters also generated a reasonable simulation of the abnormal properties of brain functional networks in people with schizophrenia. We therefore anticipate that many aspects of brain network organization, in health and disease, may be parsimoniously explained by an economical clustering rule for the probability of functional connectivity between different brain areas.},

To accommodate the formation of such structures in living cells, Praetorius and Dietz developed an approach in which custom protein staples based on transcription activator–like effector proteins fold double-stranded DNA templates (see the Perspective by Douglas). The structures folded into user-defined geometric shapes on the scale of tens to hundreds of nanometers. These nanostructures could self-assemble at room temperature in physiological buffers.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONControlling the spatial arrangement of functional components in biological systems on the scale of higher-order macromolecular assemblies is an important goal in synthetic biology. Achieving this goal could yield new research tools and pave the way for interesting applications in health and biotechnology. DNA origami enables constructing arbitrary shapes on the desired scale by folding a single-stranded DNA “scaffold” into user-defined shapes using a set of “staple” oligonucleotides, but single-stranded DNA is typically not available in living cells, and the structures usually assemble only at nonphysiological temperatures. The scope of functions that can be fulfilled by DNA itself appears so far still limited. Proteins, on the other hand, offer a large variety of functionalities and are easily accessible in cells through genetic encoding, but designing larger structural frameworks from proteins alone remains challenging.
RATIONALEHere, we reimagined DNA origami to explore the possibility for using a set of designed proteins to fold a double-stranded DNA template into user-defined DNA-protein hybrid objects with dimensions on the desired 10- to 100-nm scale. To realize our idea, we require synthetic DNA “looping” proteins that can link two user-defined double-helical DNA sequences, and we need to determine suitable rules for arranging both the template and multiple of such staple proteins in the context of a larger target structure. Transcription activator–like (TAL) effector proteins are produced by plant pathogenic bacteria and injected into host cells, where they bind to specific promoter regions, thus controlling the expression of target genes. The DNA recognizing part of a TAL effector consists of an array of repeat subunits that binds to the major groove of double-helical DNA, thus forming a superhelix. Each repeat subunit comprises {\textasciitilde}34 amino acids and recognizes a single DNA base pair. Because of their modular architecture, TAL effectors can be engineered to bind to user-defined DNA sequences, and this technique is currently being exploited for genome engineering applications. For constructing the staple proteins, we therefore chose the DNA-recognizing domains of TAL effectors.
RESULTSWe characterized the DNA-recognizing domains of the TAL effectors with respect to binding affinity and sequence specificity. To construct the staple proteins, we fused two TAL proteins via a custom peptide linker and tested for the ability to connect two separate double-helical DNA domains. For creating larger objects containing multiple staple protein connections, we identified a set of rules regarding the optimal spacing between these connections. On the basis of these rules, we could create megadalton-scale objects that realize a variety of structural motifs, such as custom curvatures, vertices, and corners. Each of those objects was built from a set of 12 double-TAL staple proteins and a template DNA double strand with designed sequence. We also tested design principles for multilayer structures with enhanced rigidity. All components of our nanostructures can be genetically encoded and self-assemble isothermally at room temperature in near-physiological buffer conditions. The staple proteins used in this work also carried a green fluorescent protein domain that serves as a placeholder for a variety of functional protein domains that can be genetically fused to the staple proteins. We were also able to demonstrate formation of our structures starting from genetic expression in a one-pot reaction mixture that contained the double-stranded DNA scaffold, the genes encoding the staple proteins, RNA polymerase, ribosomes, and cofactors for transcription and translation. Successful self-assembly of our hybrid nanostructures was confirmed using transmission electron microscopy.
CONCLUSIONBy using our system of designing double-TAL staple proteins that fold a template DNA double strand, researchers can control the spatial arrangement of protein domains in custom geometries. Our system should have a good chance to work inside cells, given the success of our in vitro expression experiments and considering that the DNA binding properties of TAL are preserved inside cells, as seen in gene editing experiments with TAL-based endonucleases. Because TAL-based staple proteins can be tailored to specifically recognize any desired DNA target sequence, these proteins could then be used to create custom structures and loops in genomic DNA to study the relation between genome architecture and gene expression, or to position proteins involved in other intracellular processes in user-defined ways. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/355/6331/eaam5488/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Schematic illustration of the self-assembly of DNA-protein hybrid objects from a set of 12 double-TAL staple proteins and a template DNA double strand.Depending on the sequence of the template, the resulting object may be a square (top) or a double-ring circle (bottom). In total, we designed 18 different protein hybrid objects using this principle. Scale bar, 20 nm.
We describe an approach to bottom-up fabrication that allows integration of the functional diversity of proteins into designed three-dimensional structural frameworks. A set of custom staple proteins based on transcription activator–like effector proteins folds a double-stranded DNA template into a user-defined shape. Each staple protein is designed to recognize and closely link two distinct double-helical DNA sequences at separate positions on the template. We present design rules for constructing megadalton-scale DNA-protein hybrid shapes; introduce various structural motifs, such as custom curvature, corners, and vertices; and describe principles for creating multilayer DNA-protein objects with enhanced rigidity. We demonstrate self-assembly of our hybrid nanostructures in one-pot mixtures that include the genetic information for the designed proteins, the template DNA, RNA polymerase, ribosomes, and cofactors for transcription and translation.

	abstract = {The relationship between the topology of a biological network and its functional or evolutionary properties has attracted much recent interest. It has been suggested that most, if not all, biological networks are ‘scale free.’ That is, their connections follow power-law distributions, such that there are very few nodes with very many connections and vice versa. The number of target genes of known transcriptional regulators in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, appears to follow such a distribution, as do other networks, such as the yeast network of protein–protein interactions. These findings have inspired attempts to draw biological inferences from general properties associated with scale-free network topology. One often cited general property is that, when compromised, highly connected nodes will tend to have a larger effect on network function than sparsely connected nodes. For example, more highly connected proteins are more likely to be lethal when knocked out. However, the correlation between lethality and connectivity is relatively weak, and some highly connected proteins can be removed without noticeable phenotypic effect. Similarly, network topology only weakly predicts the response of gene expression to environmental perturbations. Evolutionary simulations of gene-regulatory networks, presented here, suggest that such weak or non-existent correlations are to be expected, and are likely not due to inadequacy of experimental data. We argue that ‘top-down’ inferences of biological properties based on simple measures of network topology are of limited utility, and we present simulation results suggesting that much more detailed information about a gene’s location in a regulatory network, as well as dynamic gene-expression data, are needed to make more meaningful functional and evolutionary predictions. Specifically, we find in our simulations that: (1) the relationship between a gene’s connectivity and its fitness effect upon knockout depends on its equilibrium expression level; (2) correlation between connectivity and genetic variation is virtually non-existent, yet upon independent evolution of networks with identical topologies, some nodes exhibit consistently low or high polymorphism; and (3) certain genes show low polymorphism yet high divergence among independent evolutionary runs. This latter pattern is generally taken as a signature of positive selection, but in our simulations its cause is often neutral coevolution of regulatory inputs to the same gene.},

In many domains besides biology, it has been proposed that encapsulation of simpler functions in modules can reduce the risk of catastrophic failure by preventing that damage in one part spreads throughout the network Hartwell et al. 1999 ;  Albert et al. 2000. Many cellular networks are claimed to have a “scale-free” organization with few central hubs and many nodes bearing few links (Barabási and Oltvai, 2004). Such structures were suggested to resist random perturbations because of a low probability that a perturbation affects the sensitive hubs Albert et al. 2000; Jeong et al. 2000 ;  Ravasz et al. 2002. However, it is unclear to what extent these high-level abstractions are able to capture network functionality because experimental observations barely support key predictions of the theory (Hahn et al., 2004). If, for instance, crosstalk was vital for coordination of cellular functions, the pure topological argument implying equal importance of all interactions would not hold. Moreover, robustness of modules is distinct from robustness of collections of modules such as pathways or cells. Thus, we will have to account for the interplay between different cellular networks, their potential dynamics, and foremost, a rigorous comparison with experimental observations.

	abstract = {The classical view of computing positions computation as a closed-box transformation of inputs (rational numbers or finite strings) to outputs. According to the interactive view of computing, computation is an ongoing interactive process rather than a function-based transformation of an input to an output. Specifically, communication with the outside world happens during the computation, not before or after it. This approach radically changes our understanding of what is computation and how it is modeled. The acceptance of interaction as a new paradigm is hindered by the Strong Church–Turing Thesis (SCT), the widespread belief that Turing Machines (TMs) capture all computation, so models of computation more expressive than TMs are impossible. In this paper, we show that SCT reinterprets the original Church–Turing Thesis (CTT) in a way that Turing never intended; its commonly assumed equivalence to the original is a myth. We identify and analyze the historical reasons for the widespread belief in SCT. Only by accepting that it is false can we begin to adopt interaction as an alternative paradigm of computation. We present Persistent Turing Machines (PTMs), that extend TMs to capture sequential interaction. PTMs allow us to formulate the Sequential Interaction Thesis, going beyond the expressiveness of TMs and of the CTT. The paradigm shift to interaction provides an alternative understanding of the nature of computing that better reflects the services provided by today’s computing technology.},

	abstract = {An important step in genetic recombination is DNA branch migration, the movement of the Holliday junction or exchange point between two homologous duplex DNAs. We have determined kinetic parameters of spontaneous branch migration as a function of temperature and ionic conditions. The branch migration substrates consist of two homologous duplex DNAs each having two single-strand tails at one end that are complementary to the corresponding single-strand tails of the other duplex. Upon rapid annealing of the two duplex DNAs, a four-stranded intermediate is formed that has a Holliday junction at one end of the duplexes. Branch migration to the opposite end of the duplexes results in complete strand exchange and formation of two duplex products. The rate of branch migration is exceedingly sensitive to the type of metal ions present. In magnesium, branch migration is quite slow with a step time, tau, equal to 300 msec at 37 degrees C. Surprisingly, branch migration in the absence of magnesium was 1000 times faster. Despite this difference in rates, apparent activation energies for the branch migration step in the presence and absence of magnesium are similar. Since metal ions have a profound effect on the structure of the Holliday junction, it appears that the structure of the branch point plays a key role in determining the rate of spontaneous DNA branch migration. We discuss the role of proteins in promoting the branch migration step during homologous recombination.},

A general logical model is provided that integrates prior knowledge on molecular interactions and other information for capturing signal-propagation principles and compatibility with experimental data. Solutions to the abductive inference problem define signed-directed networks that explain how genes are affected during the experiments. Using in-silico datasets provided by the dialogue for reverse engineering assessments and methods (DREAM) consortium, the chapter demonstrates the improved predictive power and complexity of the inferred network topologies compared with those generated by other non-symbolic inference approaches. It also explores how the improved expressiveness together with the modularity and flexibility of the logic-based nature can support automated scientific discovery where the validity of hypothesized biological ideas can be examined and tested outside the laboratory.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been shown for an evolutionarily distant genomic comparison that the number of protein-protein interactions a protein has correlates negatively with their rates of evolution. However, the generality of this observation has recently been challenged. Here we examine the problem using protein-protein interaction data from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and genome sequences from two other yeast species.
RESULTS: In contrast to a previous study that used an incomplete set of protein-protein interactions, we observed a highly significant correlation between number of interactions and evolutionary distance to either Candida albicans or Schizosaccharomyces pombe. This study differs from the previous one in that it includes all known protein interactions from S. cerevisiae, and a larger set of protein evolutionary rates. In both evolutionary comparisons, a simple monotonic relationship was found across the entire range of the number of protein-protein interactions. In agreement with our earlier findings, this relationship cannot be explained by the fact that proteins with many interactions tend to be important to yeast. The generality of these correlations in other kingdoms of life unfortunately cannot be addressed at this time, due to the incompleteness of protein-protein interaction data from organisms other than S. cerevisiae.
CONCLUSIONS: Protein-protein interactions tend to slow the rate at which proteins evolve. This may be due to structural constraints that must be met to maintain interactions, but more work is needed to definitively establish the mechanism(s) behind the correlations we have observed.},

In a different intellectual domain, learning theory links incremental adaptation (e.g., from positive and/or negative reinforcement) to intelligent behaviour. Specifically, learning theory explains how incremental adaptation can acquire knowledge from past experience and use it to direct future behaviours toward favourable outcomes. Until recently such cognitive learning seemed irrelevant to the ‘uninformed’ process of evolution. In our opinion, however, new results formally linking evolutionary processes to the principles of learning might provide solutions to several evolutionary puzzles – the evolution of evolvability, the evolution of ecological organisation, and evolutionary transitions in individuality. If so, the ability for evolution to learn might explain how it produces such apparently intelligent designs.},

In his lecture titled "Quantum Computing and the Limits of the Efficiently Computable," Aaronson discusses what quantum computers are, whether they can be built on a large scale, and what's known today about their capabilities and limitations. He goes beyond quantum computers to touch on speculative models of computation, including closed time-like curves and nonlinearities in the Schrodinger equation — an equation that describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes in time.

An associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Aaronson's work on the subject of quantum computing has included limitations of quantum algorithms in the black-box model, the learnability of quantum states, and quantum versus classical proofs and advice. He writes a popular blog (www.scottaaronson.com/blog).

A full account of the complex cellular networks that underlie plant-specific functions is still missing. We describe a proteome-wide binary protein-protein interaction map for the interactome network of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana containing about 6200 highly reliable interactions between about 2700 proteins. A global organization of plant biological processes emerges from community analyses of the resulting network, together with large numbers of novel hypothetical functional links between proteins and pathways. We observe a dynamic rewiring of interactions following gene duplication events, providing evidence for a model of evolution acting upon interactome networks. This and future plant interactome maps should facilitate systems approaches to better understand plant biology and improve crops.

Biological systems are extraordinarily robust to perturbation by mutations, recombination and the environment. It has been proposed that this robustness might make them more evolvable. Robustness to mutation allows genetic variation to accumulate in a cryptic state. Switching mechanisms known as evolutionary capacitors mean that the amount of heritable phenotypic variation available can be correlated to the degree of stress and hence to the novelty of the environment and remaining potential for adaptation. There have been two somewhat separate literatures relating robustness to evolvability. One has focused on molecular phenotypes and new mutations, the other on morphology and cryptic genetic variation. Here, we review both literatures, and show that the true distinction is whether recombination rates are high or low. In both cases, the evidence supports the claim that robustness promotes evolvability.},

The claims presented here are pretty outlandish. Particularly relevant to "Hematology and Oncology" we now know that mice housed under different conditions with different microflora can have vastly different outcomes in any model, not just cancer. To suggest academic incompetence or outright unethical behavior is offensive, and is a particularly narrow view of why experiments are difficult to reproduce. Further, as indicated in Table 1, the entire definition of not-reproducible hinges on a priori profit motive of "robust" differences (whatever that means). There is always room for improvement in science, but this entire article is disingenuous and belittling to those of us who are on the front lines."

	abstract = {Author Summary Many biological systems show bow-tie (also called hourglass) architecture. A bow-tie means that a large number of inputs are converted to a small number of intermediates, which then fan out to generate a large number of outputs. For example, cells use a wide variety of nutrients; process them into 12 metabolic precursors, which are then used to make all of the cells biomass. Similar principles exist in biological signaling and in the information processing in the visual system. Despite the ubiquity of bow-tie structures in biology, there is no explanation of how they evolved. Here, we find that bow-ties spontaneously evolve when the information in the evolutionary goal they evolved to satisfy can be compressed. Mathematically, this means that the matrix representing the goal has deficient rank. The maximal compression possible determines the width of the bow-tie—the narrowest part in the network (equal to the rank of the goal matrix). This offers a mechanism to understand a common architectural principle of biological systems, and a way to quantitate the rank of the goals under which they evolved.},

Here we present a systematic comparative mathematical analysis of the metabolic networks of 43 organisms representing all three domains of life. We show that, despite significant variation in their individual constituents and pathways, these metabolic networks have the same topological scaling properties and show striking similarities to the inherent organization of complex non-biological systems. This may indicate that metabolic organization is not only identical for all living organisms, but also complies with the design principles of robust and error-tolerant scale-free networks, and may represent a common blueprint for the large-scale organization of interactions among all cellular constituents.},

In this review, we distinguish between two types of biological models—mathematical and computational—which differ in their representations of biological phenomena. We call the approach of constructing computational models of biological systems 'executable biology', as it focuses on the design of executable computer algorithms that mimic biological phenomena. We survey the main modeling efforts in this direction, emphasize the applicability and benefits of executable models in biological research and highlight some of the challenges that executable biology poses for biology and computer science. We claim that for executable biology to reach its full potential as a mainstream biological technique, formal and algorithmic approaches must be integrated into biological research. This will drive biology toward a more precise engineering discipline.},

However, when the number of entities is small and only qualitative knowledge is available, Boolean networks can provide important insights, such as the existence and nature of steady states or network robustness.

	abstract = {According to the interactive view of computation, communication happens during the computation, not before or after it. This approach, distinct from concurrency theory and the theory of computation, represents a paradigm shift that changes our understanding of what is computation and how it is modeled. Interaction machines extend Turing machines with interaction to capture the behavior of concurrent systems, promising to bridge these two fields. This promise is hindered by the widespread belief, incorrectly known as the Church-Turing thesis, that no model of computation more expressive than Turing machines can exist. Yet Turing’s original thesis only refers to the computation of functions and explicitly excludes other computational paradigms such as interaction. In this paper, we identify and analyze the historical reasons for this widespread belief. Only by accepting that it is false can we begin to properly investigate formal models of interaction machines. We conclude the paper by presenting one such model, Persistent Turing Machines (PTMs). PTMs capture sequential interaction, which is a limited form of concurrency; they allow us to formulate the Sequential Interaction Thesis, going beyond the expressiveness of Turing machines and of the Church-Turing thesis.},

Of particular interest is the phenomenon of multivalency, which is characterized by simultaneous binding of multiple ligands on one biological entity to multiple receptors on another. Various approaches have been developed to engineer multivalency by linking multiple ligands together. However, the effects of well-controlled inter-ligand distances on multivalency are less well understood. Recent progress in self-assembling DNA nanostructures with spatial and sequence addressability has made deterministic positioning of different molecular species possible. Here we show that distance-dependent multivalent binding effects can be systematically investigated by incorporating multiple-affinity ligands into DNA nanostructures with precise nanometre spatial control. Using atomic force microscopy, we demonstrate direct visualization of high-affinity bivalent ligands being used as pincers to capture and display protein molecules on a nanoarray. These results illustrate the potential of using designer DNA nanoscaffolds to engineer more complex and interactive biomolecular networks.},

The accumulated knowledge of decades of molecular studies in combination with new technological advances, while further highlighting the intricacies of natural systems, is also bringing back the quest-for-principles research program. Here, I present two lessons that I derived from my own quest: the importance of studying biological information processing to identify common principles in seemingly unrelated contexts and the adequacy of using known design principles at one level of biological organization as a valuable tool to help recognizing principles at an alternative one. These and additional lessons should contribute to the ultimate goal of establishing principles able to integrate the many scales of biological complexity.},

Here, we report reproducible charge transport in guanine-quadruplex (G4) DNA molecules adsorbed on a mica substrate. Currents ranging from tens of picoamperes to more than 100 pA were measured in the G4-DNA over distances ranging from tens of nanometres to more than 100 nm. Our experimental results, combined with theoretical modelling, suggest that transport occurs via a thermally activated long-range hopping between multi-tetrad segments of DNA.

Although phenotypic variance is a central measure in the mapping of the genotype and environment to the phenotype in quantitative evolutionary genetics, robustness is also a key feature in systems biology, resulting from nonlinearities in quantitative relationships between upstream and downstream components. In this Review, we provide a synthesis of these two lines of investigation, converging on understanding how variation propagates across biological systems. We critically assess the recent proliferation of studies identifying robustness-conferring genes in the context of the nonlinearity in biological systems.

	abstract = {This paper considers Web layout design in the spirit of source coding for data compression and rate distortion theory, with the aim of minimizing the average size of files downloaded during Web browsing sessions. The novel aspect here is that the object of design is layout rather than codeword selection, and is subject to navigability constraints. This produces statistics for file transfers that are heavy tailed, completely unlike standard Shannon theory, and provides a natural and plausible explanation for the origin of observed power laws in Web traffic. We introduce a series of theoretical and simulation models for optimal Web layout design with varying levels of analytic tractability and realism with respect to modeling of structure, hyperlinks, and user behavior. All models produce power laws which are striking both for their consistency with each other and with observed data, and their robustness to modeling assumptions. These results suggest that heavy tails are a permanent and ubiquitous feature of Internet traffic, and not an artifice of current applications or user behavior. They also suggest new ways of thinking about protocol design that combines insights from information and control theory with traditional networking},

	abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate performances of published gene signatures for the assessment of urothelial carcinoma.
Experimental Design: We evaluated 28 published gene signatures designed for diagnostic and prognostic purposes of urothelial cancer. The investigated signatures include eight signatures for stage, five for grade, four for progression, and six for survival. We used two algorithms for classification, nearest centroid classification and support vector machine, and Cox regression to evaluate signature performance in four independent data sets.
Results: The overlap of genes among the signatures was low, ranging from 11\% among stage signatures to 0.6\% among survival signatures. The published signatures predicted muscle-invasive and high-grade tumors with accuracies in the range of 70\% to 90\%. The performance for a given signature varied considerably with the validation data set used, and interestingly, some of the best performing signatures were not designed for the tested classification problem. In addition, several nonbladder-derived gene signatures performed equally well. Large randomly selected gene signatures performed better than the published signatures, and by systematically increasing signature size, we show that signatures with {\textgreater}150 genes are needed to obtain robust performance in independent validation data sets. None of the published survival signatures performed better than random assignments when applied to independent validation data.
Conclusion: We conclude that gene expression signatures with {\textgreater}150 genes predict muscle-invasive growth and high-grade tumors with robust accuracies. Special considerations have to be taken when designing gene signatures for outcome in bladder cancer. Clin Cancer Res; 16(17); 4421–33. ©2010 AACR.},

	abstract = {That regulatory evolution is important in generating phenotypic diversity was suggested soon after the discovery of gene regulation. In the past few decades, studies in animals have provided a number of examples in which phenotypic changes can be traced back to specific alterations in transcriptional regulation. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology and functional genomics have stimulated a new wave of investigation in simple model organisms. In particular, several genome-wide comparative analyses of transcriptional circuits across different yeast species have been performed. These studies have revealed that transcription networks are remarkably plastic: large scale rewiring in which target genes move in and out of regulons through changes in cis-regulatory sequences appears to be a general phenomenon. Transcription factor substitution and the formation of new combinatorial interactions are also important contributors to the rewiring. In several cases, a transition through intermediates with redundant regulatory programs has been suggested as a mechanism through which rewiring can occur without a loss in fitness. Because the basic features of transcriptional regulation are deeply conserved, we speculate that large scale rewiring may underlie the evolution of complex phenotypes in multi-cellular organisms; if so, such rewiring may leave traceable changes in the genome from which the genetic basis of functional innovation can be detected.},

Studies with computational models, however, have suggested that denser gene networks evolve to be more dynamically robust than sparser networks. We resolve this discrepancy by showing that misassumptions about how to measure robustness in artificial networks have inadvertently discounted the costs of network complexity. We show that when the costs of complexity are taken into account, that robustness implies a parsimonious network structure that is sparsely connected and not unnecessarily complex; and that selection will favor sparse networks when network topology is free to evolve. Because a robust system of heredity is necessary for the adaptive evolution of complex phenotypes, the maintenance of frugal network complexity is likely a crucial design constraint that underlies biological organization.},

	abstract = {Theoretical models of allometric scaling provide frameworks for understanding and predicting how and why the morphology and function of organisms vary with scale. It remains unclear, however, if the predictions of ‘universal’ scaling models for vascular plants hold across diverse species in variable environments. Phenomena such as competition and disturbance may drive allometric scaling relationships away from theoretical predictions based on an optimized tree. Here, we use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to calculate tree-specific, species-specific, and ‘global’ (i.e. interspecific) scaling exponents for several allometric relationships using tree- and branch-level data harvested from three savanna sites across a rainfall gradient in Mali, West Africa. We use these exponents to provide a rigorous test of three plant scaling models (Metabolic Scaling Theory (MST), Geometric Similarity, and Stress Similarity) in savanna systems. For the allometric relationships we evaluated (diameter vs. length, aboveground mass, stem mass, and leaf mass) the empirically calculated exponents broadly overlapped among species from diverse environments, except for the scaling exponents for length, which increased with tree cover and density. When we compare empirical scaling exponents to the theoretical predictions from the three models we find MST predictions are most consistent with our observed allometries. In those situations where observations are inconsistent with MST we find that departure from theory corresponds with expected tradeoffs related to disturbance and competitive interactions. We hypothesize savanna trees have greater length-scaling exponents than predicted by MST due to an evolutionary tradeoff between fire escape and optimization of mechanical stability and internal resource transport. Future research on the drivers of systematic allometric variation could reconcile the differences between observed scaling relationships in variable ecosystems and those predicted by ideal models such as MST.},

We show that the number of interneuronal connections of the Euclidean length d decays exponentially with d, implying that the wiring cost, defined as the sum of the interneuronal distances, plays an important role in the actual neuronal network. Using the two methods to shuffle the neuronal network in systematic ways, the edge exchange and the vertex swapping, we show that positions of neurons are not randomly distributed but organized to reduce the wiring cost. Furthermore, we discuss the trade-off between the wiring cost and the performance of the network.},

	abstract = {Many complex systems display a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. For example, relatively simple organisms grow, persist and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions, an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic network. Complex communication networks display a surprising degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. Here we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks, which include the World-Wide Web, the Internet, social networks and cells. We find that such networks display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected even by unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity). Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties of communication networks.},

	abstract = {In this review I show that the ‘3/4-power scaling law’ of metabolic rate is not universal, either within or among animal species. Significant variation in the scaling of metabolic rate with body mass is described mainly for animals, but also for unicells and plants. Much of this variation, which can be related to taxonomic, physiological, and/or environmental differences, is not adequately explained by existing theoretical models, which are also reviewed. As a result, synthetic explanatory schemes based on multiple boundary constraints and on the scaling of multiple energy-using processes are advocated. It is also stressed that a complete understanding of metabolic scaling will require the identification of both proximate (functional)and ultimate (evolutionary)causes. Four major types of intraspecific metabolic scaling with body mass are recognized [based on the power function R=aMb, where R is respiration (metabolic) rate, a is a constant, M is body mass, and b is the scaling exponent]: Type I: linear, negatively allometric (b {\textless}1); Type II: linear, isometric (b=1); Type III: nonlinear, ontogenetic shift from isometric (b=1), or nearly isometric, to negatively allometric (b {\textless}1); and Type IV: nonlinear, ontogenetic shift from positively allometric (b {\textgreater} 1) to one or two later phases of negative allometry (b {\textless}1). Ontogenetic changes in the metabolic intensity of four component processes (i.e.growth, reproduction, locomotion, and heat production) appear to be important in these different patterns of metabolic scaling. These changes may, in turn, be shaped by age (size)-specific patterns of mortality. In addition, major differences in interspecific metabolic scaling are described, especially with respect to mode of temperature regulation, body-size range, and activity level. A‘metabolic-level boundaries hypothesis’ focusing on two major constraints (surface-area limits on resource/waste exchange processes and mass/volume limits on power production) can explain much, but not all of this variation. My analysis indicates that further empirical and theoretical work is needed to understand fully the physiological and ecological bases for the considerable variation in metabolic scaling that is observed both within and among species.Recommended approaches for doing this are discussed. I conclude that the scaling of metabolism is not the simple result of a physical law, but rather appears to be the more complex result of diverse adaptations evolved in the context of both physico-chemical and ecological constraints.},

This complexity may be largely hidden in idealized laboratory settings and in normal operation, becoming conspicuous only when contributing to rare cascading failures. These puzzling and paradoxical features are neither accidental nor artificial, but derive from a deep and necessary interplay between complexity and robustness, modularity, feedback, and fragility.

Large scale experimental studies – studying the performance of a variety of optimization algorithms across a large collection of diverse problem instances – provide the resources to derive these conditions. Data mining techniques can be used to learn the relationships between the critical features of the instances and the performance of algorithms. This paper discusses how we can adequately characterize the features of a problem instance that have impact on difficulty in terms of algorithmic performance, and how such features can be defined and measured for various optimization problems. We provide a comprehensive survey of the research field with a focus on six combinatorial optimization problems: assignment, traveling salesman, and knapsack problems, bin-packing, graph coloring, and timetabling. For these problems – which are important abstractions of many real-world problems – we review hardness-revealing features as developed over decades of research, and we discuss the suitability of more problem-independent landscape metrics. We discuss how the features developed for one problem may be transferred to study related problems exhibiting similar structures.},

	abstract = {A comparison of the evolutionary rates of cranial morphology in mammals with the neutral expectation suggests that stabilizing selection is a predominant evolutionary force keeping the long-term diversification of lineages well below its potential. The rate of morphological divergence of almost all lineages, including the great apes, is substantially below the minimum neutral expectation. The divergence of the modern races of man is slightly above the minimum neutral rate but well below the maximum rate. Therefore, there is no need to invoke extraordinary mutational mechanisms, such as regulatory gene evolution, to explain what has been perceived as rapid morphological evolution in mammals. Nor does it appear that behavioral drive needs to be invoked to explain rapid morphological evolution in hominoids. Outside of man, the long-term rate of phenotypic evolution in the great apes is actually lower than that for other mammals. The data suggest that, immediately after reproductive isolation, most lineages diverge morphologically at approximately the neutral rate and that this rate declines over evolutionary time. Such a pattern is consistent with a broad class of phenotypic evolutionary models that invoke an interaction between the forces of random genetic drift, polygenic mutation, and stabilizing selection. This pattern also suggests that the apparently rapid rates of morphological evolution in modern man relative to other mammals and in mammals relative to other vertebrates are artifacts of temporal scaling.},

For a nominal familywise error rate of 5\%, the parametric statistical methods are shown to be conservative for voxelwise inference and invalid for clusterwise inference. Our results suggest that the principal cause of the invalid cluster inferences is spatial autocorrelation functions that do not follow the assumed Gaussian shape. By comparison, the nonparametric permutation test is found to produce nominal results for voxelwise as well as clusterwise inference.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been shown for an evolutionarily distant genomic comparison that the number of protein-protein interactions a protein has correlates negatively with their rates of evolution. However, the generality of this observation has recently been challenged. Here we examine the problem using protein-protein interaction data from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and genome sequences from two other yeast species.
RESULTS: In contrast to a previous study that used an incomplete set of protein-protein interactions, we observed a highly significant correlation between number of interactions and evolutionary distance to either Candida albicans or Schizosaccharomyces pombe. This study differs from the previous one in that it includes all known protein interactions from S. cerevisiae, and a larger set of protein evolutionary rates. In both evolutionary comparisons, a simple monotonic relationship was found across the entire range of the number of protein-protein interactions. In agreement with our earlier findings, this relationship cannot be explained by the fact that proteins with many interactions tend to be important to yeast. The generality of these correlations in other kingdoms of life unfortunately cannot be addressed at this time, due to the incompleteness of protein-protein interaction data from organisms other than S. cerevisiae.
CONCLUSIONS: Protein-protein interactions tend to slow the rate at which proteins evolve. This may be due to structural constraints that must be met to maintain interactions, but more work is needed to definitively establish the mechanism(s) behind the correlations we have observed.},

	abstract = {In gene regulatory circuits, the expression of individual genes is commonly modulated by a set of regulating gene products, which bind to a gene’s cis-regulatory region. This region encodes an input-output function, referred to as signal-integration logic, that maps a specific combination of regulatory signals (inputs) to a particular expression state (output) of a gene. The space of all possible signal-integration functions is vast and the mapping from input to output is many-to-one: for the same set of inputs, many functions (genotypes) yield the same expression output (phenotype). Here, we exhaustively enumerate the set of signal-integration functions that yield idential gene expression patterns within a computational model of gene regulatory circuits. Our goal is to characterize the relationship between robustness and evolvability in the signal-integration space of regulatory circuits, and to understand how these properties vary between the genotypic and phenotypic scales. Among other results, we find that the distributions of genotypic robustness are skewed, such that the majority of signal-integration functions are robust to perturbation. We show that the connected set of genotypes that make up a given phenotype are constrained to specific regions of the space of all possible signal-integration functions, but that as the distance between genotypes increases, so does their capacity for unique innovations. In addition, we find that robust phenotypes are (i) evolvable, (ii) easily identified by random mutation, and (iii) mutationally biased toward other robust phenotypes. We explore the implications of these latter observations for mutation-based evolution by conducting random walks between randomly chosen source and target phenotypes. We demonstrate that the time required to identify the target phenotype is independent of the properties of the source phenotype.},

Biological systems are extraordinarily robust to perturbation by mutations, recombination and the environment. It has been proposed that this robustness might make them more evolvable. Robustness to mutation allows genetic variation to accumulate in a cryptic state. Switching mechanisms known as evolutionary capacitors mean that the amount of heritable phenotypic variation available can be correlated to the degree of stress and hence to the novelty of the environment and remaining potential for adaptation. There have been two somewhat separate literatures relating robustness to evolvability. One has focused on molecular phenotypes and new mutations, the other on morphology and cryptic genetic variation. Here, we review both literatures, and show that the true distinction is whether recombination rates are high or low. In both cases, the evidence supports the claim that robustness promotes evolvability.},

For example, system growth has traditionally been quantified using lines of code or number of functions, but functional growth of an operating system like Linux can also be quantified using the number of system calls. In addition we use the availability of the source code to track metrics, such as McCabe’s cyclomatic complexity, that have not been tracked across so many versions previously. We find that the data supports several of Lehman’s laws, mainly those concerned with growth and with the stability of the process. We also make some novel observations, e.g. that the average complexity of functions is decreasing with time, but this is mainly due to the addition of many small functions.},

Permeabilization provides access to intracellular or intraorganellar antigens.

The organic solvents dissolve lipids from cell membranes making them permeable to antibodies. Because the organic solvents also coagulate proteins, they can be used to fix and permeabilize cells at the same time. Saponin interacts with membrane cholesterol, selectively removing it and leaving holes in the membrane. The disadvantage of detergents such as Triton X-100 and Tween-20 is that they are non-selective in nature and may extract proteins along with the lipids. This chapter provides methods for the use of organic solvents and detergents to permeabilize cell membranes.},

Our focus is on systems which are optimized, either through natural selection or engineering design, to provide robust performance despite uncertain environments. We suggest that power laws in these systems are due to tradeoffs between yield, cost of resources, and tolerance to risks. These tradeoffs lead to highly optimized designs that allow for occasional large events. We investigate the mechanism in the context of percolation and sand pile models in order to emphasize the sharp contrasts between HOT and self-organized criticality (SOC), which has been widely suggested as the origin for power laws in complex systems. Like SOC, HOT produces power laws. However, compared to SOC, HOT states exist for densities which are higher than the critical density, and the power laws are not restricted to special values of the density. The characteristic features of HOT systems include: (1) high efficiency, performance, and robustness to designed-for uncertainties; (2) hypersensitivity to design flaws and unanticipated perturbations; (3) nongeneric, specialized, structured configurations; and (4) power laws. The first three of these are in contrast to the traditional hallmarks of criticality, and are obtained by simply adding the element of design to percolation and sand pile models, which completely changes their characteristics.},

	abstract = {Canalisation (or canalization) is a measure of the ability of a population to produce the same phenotype regardless of variability of its environment or genotype. In other words, it means robustness. The term canalisation was coined by C. H. Waddington, who used the word to capture the fact that "developmental reactions, as they occur in organisms submitted to natural selection...are adjusted so as to bring about one definite end-result regardless of minor variations in conditions during the course of the reaction". He used this word rather than robustness to take into account that biological systems are not robust in quite the same way as, for example, engineered systems.
Biological robustness or canalisation comes about when developmental pathways are shaped by evolution. Waddington introduced the epigenetic landscape, in which the state of an organism rolls "downhill" during development. In this metaphor, a canalised trait is illustrated as a valley enclosed by high ridges, safely guiding the phenotype to its "fate". Waddington claimed that canals form in the epigenetic landscape during evolution, and that this heuristic is useful for understanding the unique qualities of biological robustness.

the demonstration that observed distributions of node connectivity in microbial species can emerge passively by mutational processes will contradict the idea that such patterns reflect some sort of universal trend toward adaptive design (for example, Refs 2,21).
 
If we are to be confident that the architectural features of genetic networks are advanced by natural selection, it should be possible to formally reject the possibility of neutral evolution. There is room for disagreement with what constitutes an appropriate null model for network evolution but, given that evolution is a population-level process, we start with the assumption that any such model must incorporate the fundamental principles of population genetics. Such an approach is a significant departure from most previous work in this area.
 
Although the models presented here are simplistic in many ways, ignoring, for example, the details of molecular kinetics and the likelihood that small networks will often be imbedded in a larger set of interactions, they are far more biologically realistic than previous attempts to model network evolution as a series of saltational (instantaneous and stepwise) events (for example, Refs 2,3,62–66).
(see 'evolution' subcollection under 'Network Theory" collection)
 
such studies simulate the construction of network topologies by pre-specified rules for stochastic node attachment, gene duplication and/or transcription-factor binding site origin, with no attention being given to the intermediate states that necessarily exist in the context of actual populations. Relying on this approach, deviations of observed patterns of network connectivity from those that are generated with randomly assembled networks have often been invoked as evidence for the guiding hand of natural selection in the evolution of network architecture2, 3, 67, 68.
while barabasi etc use duplication to explain pref. attach., lynch uses it as an alternative explanation for 'robustness' :Such observations raise significant questions about whether distributed robustness (the tendency for single-gene knockouts to have less-than-lethal effects as a consequence of excess network connections) evolves by natural selection21, 61, as opposed to being an unavoidable by-product of the purely physical processes of mutation and duplication.

If new connections are made preferentially to more popular nodes, then the resulting distribution of the number of connections possessed by nodes follows power laws, as observed in many real networks. Preferential attachment has been directly validated for some real networks (including the Internet), and can be a consequence of different underlying processes based on node fitness, ranking, optimization, random walks or duplication. Here we show that popularity is just one dimension of attractiveness; another dimension is similarity. We develop a framework in which new connections optimize certain trade-offs between popularity and similarity, instead of simply preferring popular nodes. The framework has a geometric interpretation in which popularity preference emerges from local optimization. As opposed to preferential attachment, our optimization framework accurately describes the large-scale evolution of technological (the Internet), social (trust relationships between people) and biological (Escherichia coli metabolic) networks, predicting the probability of new links with high precision. The framework that we have developed can thus be used for predicting new links in evolving networks, and provides a different perspective on preferential attachment as an emergent phenomenon.},

	abstract = {When a new mutant arises in a population, there is a probability it outcompetes the residents and fixes. The structure of the population can affect this fixation probability. Suppressing population structures reduce the difference between two competing variants, while amplifying population structures enhance the difference. Suppressors are ubiquitous and easy to construct, but amplifiers for the large population limit are more elusive and only a few examples have been discovered. Whether or not a population structure is an amplifier of selection depends on the probability distribution for the placement of the invading mutant. First, we prove that there exist only bounded amplifiers for adversarial placement—that is, for arbitrary initial conditions. Next, we show that the Star population structure, which is known to amplify for mutants placed uniformly at random, does not amplify for mutants that arise through reproduction and are therefore placed proportional to the temperatures of the vertices. Finally, we construct population structures that amplify for all mutational events that arise through reproduction, uniformly at random, or through some combination of the two.},

The Computational Universe - Leslie Valiant, Harvard University

The idea that computation has its own laws and limitations emerged in the 1930s. Some of the early computing pioneers, most notably Turing and von Neumann, already understood that this idea had far reaching implications beyond technology. It offered a new way of looking at the world, in terms of computational processes. Turing and von Neumann themselves pursued this perspective in such areas as genetics, biological development, cognition, and the brain. There has been much progress in the intervening years in understanding computation. The question that arises for our generation is how to exploit this increasing knowledge to obtain insights into the natural world that cannot be obtained otherwise. Valiant will focus on biological evolution approached from this standpoint. The scientific question is to determine the molecular mechanism of biological evolution, to a level of specificity that it can be simulated by computer, and to understand why this mechanism can do the remarkable things that it has done within the time that has been available. The talk will explore the tools needed to approach how this come from machine learning, the field that studies how mechanisms that achieve complex functionality can arise by a process of adaptation rather than design. 

Leslie Valiant is the T. Jefferson Coolidge Professor of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University. Valiant received his Ph.D. from Warwick University in 1974. Valiant’s work has ranged over several areas of theoretical computer science, particularly complexity theory, learning, and parallel computation. He also has interests in computational neuroscience, evolution, and artificial intelligence and is the author of two books, Circuits of the Mind (Oxford University Press, 1994) and Probably Approximately Correct (Basic Books, 2013). Valiant received the Nevanlinna Prize, the Knuth Award, the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science EATCS Award, and the A. M. Turing Award. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. http://people.seas.harvard.edu/{\textasciitilde}valiant/

Subdividing hubs with respect to this quantity provides insight into their evolutionary rate and indicates that additional mechanisms of network growth are active in evolution (beyond effective preferential attachment through gene duplication).},

On the one hand, we find a group of interactions that are simultaneously possible and a set of multi-interface hubs associated with these. Multi-interface hubs correspond, in many respects, to our “classic” notion of network hubs. They are more likely to be essential and more conserved. They are most likely members of large and stable complexes. However, they do not follow canonical models of network evolution, growing through gene duplication. On the other hand, we find a second class of interactions, mutually exclusive ones, which have a transient character and occur in singlish-interface hubs. Singlish-interface hubs are distinctly “nonclassical”: They are neither likely to be essential, nor conserved.

	abstract = {Control theory is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and mathematics that deals with the behavior of dynamical systems with inputs, and how their behavior is modified by feedback. The usual objective of control theory is to control a system, often called the plant, so its output follows a desired control signal, called the reference, which may be a fixed or changing value. To do this a controller is designed, which monitors the output and compares it with the reference. The difference between actual and desired output, called the error signal, is applied as feedback to the input of the system, to bring the actual output closer to the reference. Some topics studied in control theory are stability; whether the output will converge to the reference value or oscillate about it; controllability and observability.},

In this paper, we, examine three important aspects of power law graphs, (1) the evolution of power law graphs, (2) the asymmetry of in-degrees and out-degrees, (3) the "scale invariance" of power law graphs. In particular, we give three increasingly general directed graph models and one general undirected graph model for generating power law graphs by adding at most one node and possibly one or more edges at a time. We show that for any given edge density and desired power laws for in-degrees and out-degrees, not necessarily the same, the resulting graph will almost surely have the desired edge density and the power laws for the in-degrees and out-degrees. Our most general directed and undirected models include nearly all known power law evolution models as special cases. Finally, we show that our evolution models generate "scale invariant" graphs. We describe a method for scaling the time in our evolution model such that the power law of the degree sequences remains invariant.},

	abstract = {Large branched DNA structures are constructed by two-step reassociation of separated complementary strands from restriction fragments of different lengths. The displacement of DNA strands initially annealed to longer complementary DNA sequences, a process mediated by branch migration, is very rapid and has thus far been followed only under conditions which are second order, DNA reassociation rate limiting. The average lifetime of branched DNA leading to displacement of 1.6 Kb strands is estimated to be less than 10 seconds under conditions of DNA reassociation, Tm-25 degrees C. Several DNA-binding drugs, including intercalating dyes, have been tested to determine their influence, if any, on the kinetics of DNA strand displacements by branch migration. Only actinomycin D was found to have significant effect under the conditions we have described. The kinetics of the strand displacement in the presence of low concentrations of actinomycin D remain second order and slower rate of strand displacement must be attributed to decreased rate of reassociation of DNA strands to form the branched intermediates. Consideration is given to the potential manipulation of DNA structures at site-directed branches and the limitations due to rapid strand displacements. The feasibility of constructing sufficiently large branched DNA regions to approach first order, branch migration rate limiting kinetics is also discussed.},

Large scale experimental studies – studying the performance of a variety of optimization algorithms across a large collection of diverse problem instances – provide the resources to derive these conditions. Data mining techniques can be used to learn the relationships between the critical features of the instances and the performance of algorithms. This paper discusses how we can adequately characterize the features of a problem instance that have impact on difficulty in terms of algorithmic performance, and how such features can be defined and measured for various optimization problems. We provide a comprehensive survey of the research field with a focus on six combinatorial optimization problems: assignment, traveling salesman, and knapsack problems, bin-packing, graph coloring, and timetabling. For these problems – which are important abstractions of many real-world problems – we review hardness-revealing features as developed over decades of research, and we discuss the suitability of more problem-independent landscape metrics. We discuss how the features developed for one problem may be transferred to study related problems exhibiting similar structures.},

Here, we examine the relationship between genetic signatures of adaptive evolution and network topology. We find a striking tendency of proteins that have been under positive selection (as compared with the chimpanzee) to be located at the periphery of the interaction network. Our results are based on the analysis of two types of genome evolution, both in terms of intra- and interspecies variation. First, we looked at single-nucleotide polymorphisms and their fixed variants, single-nucleotide differences in the human genome relative to the chimpanzee. Second, we examine fixed structural variants, specifically large segmental duplications and their polymorphic precursors known as copy number variants. We propose two complementary mechanisms that lead to the observed trends. First, we can rationalize them in terms of constraints imposed by protein structure: We find that positively selected sites are preferentially located on the exposed surface of proteins. Because central network proteins (hubs) are likely to have a larger fraction of their surface involved in interactions, they tend to be constrained and under negative selection. Conversely, we show that the interaction network roughly maps to cellular organization, with the periphery of the network corresponding to the cellular periphery (i.e., extracellular space or cell membrane). This suggests that the observed positive selection at the network periphery may be due to an increase of adaptive events on the cellular periphery responding to changing environments.},

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

	abstract = {Transcription factors bind in a combinatorial fashion to specify the on-and-off states of genes; the ensemble of these binding events forms a regulatory network, constituting the wiring diagram for a cell. To examine the principles of the human transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the genomic binding information of 119 transcription-related factors in over 450 distinct experiments. We found the combinatorial, co-association of transcription factors to be highly context specific: distinct combinations of factors bind at specific genomic locations. In particular, there are significant differences in the binding proximal and distal to genes. We organized all the transcription factor binding into a hierarchy and integrated it with other genomic information (for example, microRNA regulation), forming a dense meta-network. Factors at different levels have different properties; for instance, top-level transcription factors more strongly influence expression and middle-level ones co-regulate targets to mitigate information-flow bottlenecks. Moreover, these co-regulations give rise to many enriched network motifs (for example, noise-buffering feed-forward loops). Finally, more connected network components are under stronger selection and exhibit a greater degree of allele-specific activity (that is, differential binding to the two parental alleles). The regulatory information obtained in this study will be crucial for interpreting personal genome sequences and understanding basic principles of human biology and disease.},

Three of these amplified products were cloned and their ends were sequenced. All three contained a copy of the primer at both 5' ends, and the position of one of the primers represented the authentic primer binding site. In each case, the location of the second copy of the primer indicated that it had initially hybridized to a partially homologous sequence in the template DNA. This single primer reaction makes it possible to amplify and clone a DNA region of unknown sequence that is adjacent to a known DNA sequence.

Efforts to construct synthetic networks in living cells have been hindered by the limited number of regulatory components that provide wide dynamic range and low crosstalk. Here, we report a class of de-novo-designed prokaryotic riboregulators called toehold switches that activate gene expression in response to cognate RNAs with arbitrary sequences. Toehold switches provide a high level of orthogonality and can be forward engineered to provide average dynamic range above 400. We show that switches can be integrated into the genome to regulate endogenous genes and use them as sensors that respond to endogenous RNAs. We exploit the orthogonality of toehold switches to regulate 12 genes independently and to construct a genetic circuit that evaluates 4-input AND logic. Toehold switches, with their wide dynamic range, orthogonality, and programmability, represent a versatile and powerful platform for regulation of translation, offering diverse applications in molecular biology, synthetic biology, and biotechnology.},

An interesting observation is that although many simulation systems chose to use Hill kinetics to generate data, none of the reconstruction algorithms were developed based on the Hill kinetics. One possible explanation is that, in Hill kinetics, activation and inhibition interactions take different mathematical forms, which brings additional combinatorial complexity into the reconstruction problem. We propose a new model that qualitatively behaves similar to the Hill kinetics, but has the same mathematical form for both activation and inhibition. We developed an algorithm to reconstruct gene networks based on this new model. Simulation results suggested a novel biological hypothesis that in gene knockout experiments, repressing protein synthesis to a certain extent may lead to better expression data and higher network reconstruction accuracy.},

MWUA maximizes a tradeoff between cumulative performance and entropy, which suggests a new view on the maintenance of diversity in evolution.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary dynamics have been traditionally studied in the context of homogeneous or spatially extended populations. Here we generalize population structure by arranging individuals on a graph. Each vertex represents an individual. The weighted edges denote reproductive rates which govern how often individuals place offspring into adjacent vertices. The homogeneous population, described by the Moran process, is the special case of a fully connected graph with evenly weighted edges. Spatial structures are described by graphs where vertices are connected with their nearest neighbours. We also explore evolution on random and scale-free networks. We determine the fixation probability of mutants, and characterize those graphs for which fixation behaviour is identical to that of a homogeneous population. Furthermore, some graphs act as suppressors and others as amplifiers of selection. It is even possible to find graphs that guarantee the fixation of any advantageous mutant. We also study frequency-dependent selection and show that the outcome of evolutionary games can depend entirely on the structure of the underlying graph. Evolutionary graph theory has many fascinating applications ranging from ecology to multi-cellular organization and economics.},

It has been proposed that such broad-tailed distributions are observed because they confer robustness against mutations to the network. We evaluate this hypothesis for two genetic networks, that of the E. coli core intermediary metabolism and that of the yeast protein-interaction network. Specifically, we test the hypothesis through one of its key predictions: highly connected proteins should be more important to the cell and, thus, subject to more severe selective and evolutionary constraints. We find, however, that no correlation between highly connected proteins and evolutionary rate exists in the E. coli metabolic network and that there is only a weak correlation in the yeast protein-interaction network. Furthermore, we show that the observed correlation is function-specific within the protein-interaction network: only genes involved in the cell cycle and transcription show significant correlations. Our work sheds light on conflicting results by previous researchers by comparing data from multiple types of protein-interaction datasets and by using a closely related species as a reference taxon. The finding that highly connected proteins can tolerate just as many amino acid substitutions as other proteins leads us to conclude that power-laws in cellular networks do not reflect selection for mutational robustness.},

	annote = {Do small network diameters matter to cells? A possible advantage of small mean path lengths in metabolic networks stems from the importance of minimizing transition times between metabolic states in response to environmental changes (Edwards and Palsson 2000). Metabolic networks with small diameters thus might adjust more rapidly to environmental change. Answering this question by direct experimentation, however, is currently impossible, for doing so would require comparing biological networks of different large-scale structure invivo. Absent direct experimental tests showing whether genetic network diameter matters to organisms, one can still test key predictions of this hypothesis. One such prediction is that highly connected proteins should be more important to the cell and, thus, be subject to severe selective and evolutionary constraints. One way to test this prediction is to study the rate of evolution of proteins in these networks. We examine this rate in two genetic networks: the Saccharomycescerevisiae protein-interaction network (Ito et al. 2001; Uetz et al. 2000; Wagner 2001) and the Escherichiacoli metabolic network (Wagner and Fell 2001).},

The exact core cannot, however, be identified before KP is solved to optimality, thus, previous algorithms had to rely on approximate core sizes. In this paper we present an algorithm for KP where the enumerated core size is minimal, and the computational effort for sorting and reduction also is limited according to a hierarchy. The algorithm is based on a dynamic programming approach, where the core size is extended by need, and the sorting and reduction is performed in a similar “lazy” way. Computational experiments are presented for several commonly occurring types of data instances. Experience from these tests indicate that the presented approach outperforms any known algorithm for KP, having very stable solution times.},

Nevertheless, alternative approaches to modeling the Internet often make extremely different assumptions and derive opposite conclusions about fundamental properties of one and the same system. Fortunately, a detailed understanding of Internet technology combined with a unique ability to measure the network means that these differences can be understood thoroughly and resolved unambiguously. This article aims to make recent results of this process accessible beyond Internet specialists to the broader scientific community and to clarify several sources of basic methodological differences that are relevant beyond either the Internet or the two specific approaches focused on here (i.e., scale-free networks and highly optimized tolerance networks).},

Indeed, this scenario seems reasonable for some of the highly connected compounds involved in intermediary metabolism, e.g.oxaloacetate, pyruvate, glutamate, as well as some amino acids pointed by the authors. A strict application of this model would however lead to impossibilities, since it would imply that ATP appeared before adenosine, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine before cysteine, etc. The preferential attachment model may thus partly explain some relationships between central and peripheral metabolism, but should certainly not be considered as the reason for the topological properties of the network (hubs, degree distribution).}

The complex properties of real-world networks have a profound impact on the behavior of equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena occurring in various systems, and the study of epidemic spreading is central to our understanding of the unfolding of dynamical processes in complex networks. The theoretical analysis of epidemic spreading in heterogeneous networks requires the development of novel analytical frameworks, and it has produced results of conceptual and practical relevance. A coherent and comprehensive review of the vast research activity concerning epidemic processes is presented, detailing the successful theoretical approaches as well as making their limits and assumptions clear. Physicists, mathematicians, epidemiologists, computer, and social scientists share a common interest in studying epidemic spreading and rely on similar models for the description of the diffusion of pathogens, knowledge, and innovation. For this reason, while focusing on the main results and the paradigmatic models in infectious disease modeling, the major results concerning generalized social contagion processes are also presented. Finally, the research activity at the forefront in the study of epidemic spreading in coevolving, coupled, and time-varying networks is reported.},

Despite the fact that structure can promote the emergence of cooperation in some populations, it can suppress it in others. Thus, a detailed understanding of the influence of population structure is crucial for describing the features that allow cooperative behaviors to spread. Here, we provide a complete description of when selection favors cooperation on regular graphs under birth-death and death-birth updating for any initial configuration. We find that cooperation is never favored for birth-death updating. For death-birth updating, we derive a simple, computationally tractable formula for natural selection to favor cooperation when starting from any given initial configuration. This formula elucidates two important features concerning the emergence of cooperation: (i) the takeover of cooperation can be enhanced by the strategic placement of cooperators, and (ii) adding more cooperators to the initial configuration can sometimes suppress the evolution of cooperation.},

	volume = {3},
	issn = {1471-2148},
	shorttitle = {No simple dependence between protein evolution rate and the number of protein-protein interactions},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that rates of protein evolution are influenced, to a great extent, by the proportion of amino acid residues that are directly involved in protein function. In agreement with this hypothesis, recent work has shown a negative correlation between evolutionary rates and the number of protein-protein interactions. However, the extent to which the number of protein-protein interactions influences evolutionary rates remains unclear. Here, we address this question at several different levels of evolutionary relatedness.
RESULTS: Manually curated data on the number of protein-protein interactions among Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins was examined for possible correlation with evolutionary rates between S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe orthologs. Only a very weak negative correlation between the number of interactions and evolutionary rate of a protein was observed. Furthermore, no relationship was found between a more general measure of the evolutionary conservation of S. cerevisiae proteins, based on the taxonomic distribution of their homologs, and the number of protein-protein interactions. However, when the proteins from yeast were assorted into discrete bins according to the number of interactions, it turned out that 6.5\% of the proteins with the greatest number of interactions evolved, on average, significantly slower than the rest of the proteins. Comparisons were also performed using protein-protein interaction data obtained with high-throughput analysis of Helicobacter pylori proteins. No convincing relationship between the number of protein-protein interactions and evolutionary rates was detected, either for comparisons of orthologs from two completely sequenced H. pylori strains or for comparisons of H. pylori and Campylobacter jejuni orthologs, even when the proteins were classified into bins by the number of interactions.
CONCLUSION: The currently available comparative-genomic data do not support the hypothesis that the evolutionary rates of the majority of proteins substantially depend on the number of protein-protein interactions they are involved in. However, a small fraction of yeast proteins with the largest number of interactions (the hubs of the interaction network) tend to evolve slower than the bulk of the proteins.},

To better understand the impact of UGC systems, we have analyzed YouTube, the world's largest UGC VoD system. Based on a large amount of data collected, we provide an in-depth study of YouTube and other similar UGC systems. In particular, we study the popularity life-cycle of videos, the intrinsic statistical properties of requests and their relationship with video age, and the level of content aliasing or of illegal content in the system. We also provide insights on the potential for more efficient UGC VoD systems (e.g. utilizing P2P techniques or making better use of caching). Finally, we discuss the opportunities to leverage the latent demand for niche videos that are not reached today due to information filtering effects or other system scarcity distortions. Overall, we believe that the results presented in this paper are crucial in understanding UGC systems and can provide valuable information to ISPs, site administrators, and content owners with major commercial and technical implications.},

Metazoan evolution is marked by great morphological and physiological diversification, although the core genetic, cell biological, and developmental processes are largely conserved. Metazoan diversification has entailed the evolution of various regulatory processes controlling the time, place, and conditions of use of the conserved core processes. These regulatory processes, and certain of the core processes, have special properties relevant to evolutionary change. The properties of versatile protein elements, weak linkage, compartmentation, redundancy, and exploratory behavior reduce the interdependence of components and confer robustness and flexibility on processes during embryonic development and in adult physiology. They also confer evolvability on the organism by reducing constraints on change and allowing the accumulation of nonlethal variation. Evolvability may have been generally selected in the course of selection for robust, flexible processes suitable for complex development and physiology and specifically selected in lineages undergoing repeated radiations.},

Wolpert had previously derived no free lunch theorems for machine learning (statistical inference). In 2005, Wolpert and Macready themselves indicated that the first theorem in their paper "state[s] that any two optimization algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems". The 1997 theorems of Wolpert and Macready are mathematically technicaland some find them unintuitive. The folkloric "no free lunch" (NFL) theorem is an easily stated and easily understood consequence of theorems Wolpert and Macready actually prove. It is weaker than the proven theorems, and thus does not encapsulate them.
Various investigators have extended the work of Wolpert and Macready substantively. See No free lunch in search and optimization for treatment of the research area.},

By the undecidability of the Halting Problem, the long-term prospects of a system that can simulate a Turing Machine cannot be determined computationally. We investigate the interplay between these two forces -- unaccounted-for errors and Turing-completeness. We show that the introduction of even a small amount of noise into a dynamical system is sufficient to "destroy" Turing-completeness, and to make the system's long-term behavior computationally predictable. On a more technical level, we deal with long-term statistical properties of dynamical systems, as described by invariant measures. We show that while there are simple dynamical systems for which the invariant measures are non-computable, perturbing such systems makes the invariant measures efficiently computable. Thus, noise that makes the short term behavior of the system harder to predict, may make its long term statistical behavior computationally tractable. We also obtain some insight into the computational complexity of predicting systems affected by random noise.},

The LASP-PCR was used to walk along the Oropouche M RNA completing the sequence in seven successive walks. The amplicons obtained in each walking step ranged from 300 to 1100 bp; however, amplicons of up to 3970 bp was obtained when the extension time of the LASP-PCR was increased from 120 to 270 s. This method was tested successfully for Escherichia coli and cytomegalovirus obtaining amplicons of up to 2130 and 6500 bp, respectively, indicating that it can be applied to amplify unknown DNA sequences adjacent to a short stretch of known sequence of more complex genomes.},

	abstract = {This review describes a new vision for future directions in the study of metastatic cancer biology and pathology. It is based upon clinical and experimental observations on the constituent cell lineages within a neoplasm and on tumour-host interactions. The vision incorporates information from studies in population biology, developmental biology and experimental pathology as well as investigations upon human malignant disease. The assembled information reveals that invasion and metastasis are supra-cellular manifestations of “emergent behavior” among combinations of normal and malignant cell lineages in vivo. Emergent behavior is a combinatorial interactive process in which a population displays new traits which cannot be achieved by individuals acting separately and which subside when the specific population mix disaggregates. Disruption of such pathological interactions in the field of a developing primary or secondary tumour is, therefore, required to disable the malignant population and arrest progression without tissue destruction. These conclusions originate, in part, from principles which govern the sociobiology and group behavior of bees, ants, fish, birds and human societies. In all these social organisms, external factors can disrupt signaling mechanisms and induce expanding self-perpetuating rogue behavior, leading to social disintegration. These principles also apply to cellular societies composing higher animals, which likewise need intrinsic rules to maintain social order and avoid anarchy, and recognition of this is essential for advancing future research on the mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis and metastasis. Summarised evidence is presented here to support the conclusion that miscommunications between cells and tissues in the region of the developing tumour and its metastases are the main direct perpetrators of malignant disease. Genetic lesions (mutations, deletions, translocations, reduplications, etc.), commonly seen in cancers, can significantly disrupt important molecular pathways in the networks of communications needed to sustain orderly tissue/organ structure and function. However, genetic lesions can also, themselves, be induced by abnormal cell interactions initiated by extrinsic carcinogenic agents such as chemicals, viruses, hormones and radiation. The evidence shows that, irrespective of the initiating cause, it is this miscommunication in the region of a developing tumour and its metastases that is ultimately responsible for the emergence and progression of the disease. The article describes how this information collectively, provides a framework for designing specific novel therapeutic approaches targeting the cell and tissue interactions driving tumour metastasis and its manifold effects on the whole body.},

	abstract = {Allometry is the study of the relationship of body size to shape, anatomy, physiology and finally behaviour, first outlined by Otto Snell in 1892, D'Arcy Thompson in 1917 in On Growth and Form and Julian Huxley in 1932. Allometry is a well-known study, particularly in statistical shape analysis for its theoretical developments, as well as in biology for practical applications to the differential growth rates of the parts of a living organism's body. One application is in the study of various insect species (e.g., the Hercules Beetle), where a small change in overall body size can lead to an enormous and disproportionate increase in the dimensions of appendages such as legs, antennae, or horns. The relationship between the two measured quantities is often expressed as a power law:
 or in a logarithmic form: 
where  is the scaling exponent of the law. Methods for estimating this exponent from data use type 2 regressions such as major axis regression or reduced major axis regression as these account for the variation in both variables, contrary to least squares regression, which does not account for error variance in the independent variable (e.g., log body mass). Other methods include measurement error models and a particular kind of principal component analysis.
Allometry often studies shape differences in terms of ratios of the objects' dimensions. Two objects of different size but common shape will have their dimensions in the same ratio. Take, for example, a biological object that grows as it matures. Its size changes with age but the shapes are similar. Studies of ontogenetic allometry often use lizards or snakes as model organisms because they lack parental care after birth or hatching and because they exhibit a large range of body size between the juvenile and adult stage. Lizards often exhibit allometric changes during their ontogeny.
In addition to studies that focus on growth, allometry also examines shape variation among individuals of a given age (and sex), which is referred to as static allometry. Comparisons of species are used to examine interspecific or evolutionary allometry (see also Phylogenetic comparative methods).},

Here, we present the wiring diagram of the posterior nervous system of the C. elegans adult male, reconstructed from serial electron micrograph sections. This region of the male nervous system contains the sexually dimorphic circuits for mating. The synaptic connections, both chemical and gap junctional, form a neural network with four striking features: multiple, parallel, short synaptic pathways directly connecting sensory neurons to end organs; recurrent and reciprocal connectivity among sensory neurons; modular substructure; and interneurons acting in feedforward loops. These features help to explain how the network robustly and rapidly selects and executes the steps of a behavioral program on the basis of the inputs from multiple sensory neurons.
The complete wiring structure of the synaptic network governing mating behavior of male nematodes is revealed.

	abstract = {We have developed an improved, less disruptive procedure for the transient permeabilization of neonatal cardiac myocytes using saponin. The method allows delivery of peptides to a high percentage of cells in culture without effects on long-term cell viability. Permeation was confirmed microscopically by cellular uptake of a fluorescently labeled peptide and biochemically by uptake of 125I-labeled calmodulin and a 20-kD protein kinase Cε fragment into the cells. The intracellular molar concentration of the introduced peptide was ≈10\% of that applied outside. We found no significant effects of permeabilization on spontaneous, phorbol ester–modulated, or norepinephrine-modulated contraction rates. Similarly, the expression of c-fos mRNA (measured 30 minutes after permeabilization) and the incorporation of [14C]phenylalanine following agonist stimulation (measured 3 days after permeabilization) were not altered by saponin permeabilization. Finally, permeabilization of cells in the presence of a protein kinase C pseudosubstrate peptide, but not a control peptide, inhibited phorbol ester–induced [14C]phenylalanine incorporation into proteins by 80\%. Our results demonstrate a methodology for the introduction of peptides into neonatal cardiac myocytes that allows study of their actions without substantial compromises in cell integrity.},

	abstract = {Choosing appropriate primers is probably the single most important factor affecting the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Specific amplification of the intended target requires that primers do not have matches to other targets in certain orientations and within certain distances that allow undesired amplification. The process of designing specific primers typically involves two stages. First, the primers flanking regions of interest are generated either manually or using software tools; then they are searched against an appropriate nucleotide sequence database using tools such as BLAST to examine the potential targets. However, the latter is not an easy process as one needs to examine many details between primers and targets, such as the number and the positions of matched bases, the primer orientations and distance between forward and reverse primers. The complexity of such analysis usually makes this a time-consuming and very difficult task for users, especially when the primers have a large number of hits. Furthermore, although the BLAST program has been widely used for primer target detection, it is in fact not an ideal tool for this purpose as BLAST is a local alignment algorithm and does not necessarily return complete match information over the entire primer range.},

Central results in computer science describe the complexity of algorithms that solve certain classes of problems. An algorithm is deemed efficient if it can solve a problem in polynomial time, which means the running time of the algorithm is a polynomial function of the length of the input. There are classes of harder problems for which the fastest possible algorithm requires exponential time. Another criterion is the space requirement of the algorithm. There is a crucial distinction between algorithms that can find a solution, verify a solution, or list several distinct solutions in given time and space. The complexity hierarchy that is generated in this way is the foundation of theoretical computer science. Precise complexity results can be notoriously difficult. The famous question whether polynomial time equals nondeterministic polynomial time (i.e., P = NP) is one of the hardest open problems in computer science and all of mathematics. Here, we consider simple processes of ecological and evolutionary spatial dynamics. The basic question is: What is the probability that a new invader (or a new mutant) will take over a resident population? We derive precise complexity results for a variety of scenarios. We therefore show that some fundamental questions in this area cannot be answered by simple equations (assuming that P is not equal to NP).},

This complexity may be largely hidden in idealized laboratory settings and in normal operation, becoming conspicuous only when contributing to rare cascading failures. These puzzling and paradoxical features are neither accidental nor artificial, but derive from a deep and necessary interplay between complexity and robustness, modularity, feedback, and fragility.

This shift from adaptationism to evolvability is a significant move for, as I argue, we can make sense of these universal principles without making any adaptationism claims. Furthermore, evolvability highlights important aspects of engineering that are ignored in the adaptationist debates. I introduce some novel engineering examples that incorporate these key neglected aspects, and use these examples to challenge some commonly cited contrasts between engineering and evolution, and to highlight some novel resemblances that have gone unnoticed.},

Understanding how complex phenotypes arise from individual molecules and their interactions is a primary challenge in biology that computational approaches are poised to tackle. We report a whole-cell computational model of the life cycle of the human pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium that includes all of its molecular components and their interactions. An integrative approach to modeling that combines diverse mathematics enabled the simultaneous inclusion of fundamentally different cellular processes and experimental measurements. Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions. We conclude that comprehensive whole-cell models can be used to facilitate biological discovery.},

	abstract = {Despite considerable progress in genome- and proteome-based high-throughput screening methods and in rational drug design, the increase in approved drugs in the past decade did not match the increase of drug development costs. Network description and analysis not only give a systems-level understanding of drug action and disease complexity, but can also help to improve the efficiency of drug design. We give a comprehensive assessment of the analytical tools of network topology and dynamics. The state-of-the-art use of chemical similarity, protein structure, protein–protein interaction, signaling, genetic interaction and metabolic networks in the discovery of drug targets is summarized. We propose that network targeting follows two basic strategies. The “central hit strategy” selectively targets central nodes/edges of the flexible networks of infectious agents or cancer cells to kill them. The “network influence strategy” works against other diseases, where an efficient reconfiguration of rigid networks needs to be achieved by targeting the neighbors of central nodes/edges. It is shown how network techniques can help in the identification of single-target, edgetic, multi-target and allo-network drug target candidates. We review the recent boom in network methods helping hit identification, lead selection optimizing drug efficacy, as well as minimizing side-effects and drug toxicity. Successful network-based drug development strategies are shown through the examples of infections, cancer, metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Summarizing \&gt;1200 references we suggest an optimized protocol of network-aided drug development, and provide a list of systems-level hallmarks of drug quality. Finally, we highlight network-related drug development trends helping to achieve these hallmarks by a cohesive, global approach.},

In recent years the field of evolutionary computation has developed a rigorous analytical theory to analyse their runtime on many illustrative problems. Here we apply this theory to a simple model of natural evolution. In the Strong Selection Weak Mutation (SSWM) evolutionary regime the time between occurrence of new mutations is much longer than the time it takes for a new beneficial mutation to take over the population. In this situation, the population only contains copies of one genotype and evolution can be modelled as a (1+1)-type process where the probability of accepting a new genotype (improvements or worsenings) depends on the change in fitness. We present an initial runtime analysis of SSWM, quantifying its performance for various parameters and investigating differences to the (1+1)EA. We show that SSWM can have a moderate advantage over the (1+1)EA at crossing fitness valleys and study an example where SSWM outperforms the (1+1)EA by taking advantage of information on the fitness gradient.},

	abstract = {Macroevolution is evolution on a scale of separated gene pools. Macroevolutionary studies focus on change that occurs at or above the level of species, in contrast with microevolution, which refers to smaller evolutionary changes (typically described as changes in allele frequencies) within a species or population. Macroevolution and microevolution describe fundamentally identical processes on different time scales.
The process of speciation may fall within the purview of either, depending on the forces thought to drive it. Paleontology, evolutionary developmental biology, comparative genomics and genomic phylostratigraphy contribute most of the evidence for the patterns and processes that can be classified as macroevolution. An example of macroevolution is the appearance of feathers during the evolution of birds from theropod dinosaurs.
The evolutionary course of Equidae (wide family including all horses and related animals) is often viewed as a typical example of macroevolution. The earliest known genus, Hyracotherium (now reclassified as a palaeothere), was a herbivore animal resembling a dog that lived in the early Cenozoic. As its habitat transformed into an open arid grassland, selective pressure required that the animal become a fast grazer. Thus elongation of legs and head as well as reduction of toes gradually occurred, producing the only extant genus of Equidae, Equus.

	abstract = {Why isn’t random variation always deleterious? Are there factors that sometimes make adaptation easier? Biological systems are extraordinarily robust to perturbation by mutations, recombination and the environment. It has been proposed that this robustness might make them more evolvable. Robustness to mutation allows genetic variation to accumulate in a cryptic state. Switching mechanisms known as evolutionary capacitors mean that the amount of heritable phenotypic variation available can be correlated to the degree of stress and hence to the novelty of the environment and remaining potential for adaptation. There have been two somewhat separate literatures relating robustness to evolvability. One has focused on molecular phenotypes and new mutations, the other on morphology and cryptic genetic variation. Here, we review both literatures, and show that the true distinction is whether recombination rates are high or low. In both cases, the evidence supports the claim that robustness promotes evolvability.},

Whereas Y 0 varies with the trait and type of organism, b characteristically takes on a limited number of values, all of which are simple multiples of 1/4. For example, diameters of tree trunks and aortas scale asM 3/8 rates of cellular metabolism and heartbeat as M −1/4, blood circulation time and life span as M 1/4, and whole-organism metabolic rate as M 3/4.

We present an in silico benchmark suite that we provided as a blinded, community-wide challenge within the context of the DREAM (Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods) project. We assess the performance of 29 gene-network-inference methods, which have been applied independently by participating teams. Performance profiling reveals that current inference methods are affected, to various degrees, by different types of systematic prediction errors. In particular, all but the best-performing method failed to accurately infer multiple regulatory inputs (combinatorial regulation) of genes. The results of this community-wide experiment show that reliable network inference from gene expression data remains an unsolved problem, and they indicate potential ways of network reconstruction improvements.},

Assumption that brain functionality is specified by neuronal connectivity, implemented by costly biological wiring, leads to the following optimal design problem. For a given neuronal connectivity, find a spatial layout of neurons that minimizes the wiring cost. Unfortunately, this problem is difficult to solve because the number of possible layouts is often astronomically large. We argue that the wiring cost may scale as wire length squared, reducing the optimal layout problem to a constrained minimization of a quadratic form. For biologically plausible constraints, this problem has exact analytical solutions, which give reasonable approximations to actual layouts in the brain. These solutions make the inverse problem of inferring neuronal connectivity from neuronal layout more tractable.},

Integrating the information and dynamics from one scale to another is critical for the understanding of human physiology and the treatment of diseases. Multi-scale modeling, as a computational approach, has been widely adopted by researchers in computational and systems biology. A key unsolved issue is how to represent appropriately the dynamical behaviors of a high-dimensional model of a lower scale by a low-dimensional model of a higher scale, so that it can be used to investigate complex dynamical behaviors at even higher scales of integration. In the article, we first review the widely-used different modeling methodologies and their applications at different scales. We then discuss the gaps between different modeling methodologies and between scales, and discuss potential methods for bridging the gaps between scales.},

	abstract = {The brain is expensive, incurring high material and metabolic costs for its size — relative to the size of the body — and many aspects of brain network organization can be mostly explained by a parsimonious drive to minimize these costs. However, brain networks or connectomes also have high topological efficiency, robustness, modularity and a 'rich club' of connector hubs. Many of these and other advantageous topological properties will probably entail a wiring-cost premium. We propose that brain organization is shaped by an economic trade-off between minimizing costs and allowing the emergence of adaptively valuable topological patterns of anatomical or functional connectivity between multiple neuronal populations. This process of negotiating, and re-negotiating, trade-offs between wiring cost and topological value continues over long (decades) and short (millisecond) timescales as brain networks evolve, grow and adapt to changing cognitive demands. An economical analysis of neuropsychiatric disorders highlights the vulnerability of the more costly elements of brain networks to pathological attack or abnormal development.},

Here we construct and evolve a simple developmental model in which the pleiotropic effects of genes can evolve. We demonstrate that selection in a changing environment favors a specific pattern of variability, and that this favored pattern maximizes evolvability. Our analysis shows that mutant genotypes with higher evolvability are more likely to increase to fixation. We also show that populations of highly evolvable genotypes are much less likely to be invaded by mutants with lower evolvability, and that this dynamic primarily shapes evolvability. We examine several theoretical objections to the evolution of evolvability in light of this result. We also show that this result is robust to the presence or absence of recombination, and explore how nonrandom environmental change can select for a modular pattern of variability.},

In particular, without knowing the molecular details, we want to determine how cells reliably perform essential intracellular tasks. Recent analyses of signaling pathways and regulatory transcription networks have revealed a common network architecture, termed scale-free topology. Although the structural properties of such networks have been thoroughly studied, their dynamical properties remain largely unexplored. We present a prototype for the study of dynamical systems to predict the functional robustness of intracellular networks against variations of their internal parameters. We demonstrate that the dynamical robustness of these complex networks is a direct consequence of their scale-free topology. By contrast, networks with homogeneous random topologies require fine-tuning of their internal parameters to sustain stable dynamical activity. Considering the ubiquity of scale-free networks in nature, we hypothesize that this topology is not only the result of aggregation processes such as preferential attachment; it may also be the result of evolutionary selective processes.},

	abstract = {The formation of a duplex between two nucleic acid strands is restricted if one of the strands forms an intra- or intermolecular secondary structure. The formation of the new duplex requires the dissociation and replacement of the initial structure. To understand the mechanism of this type of kinetics we studied the replacement of a labeled DNA oligonucleotide probe bound to a complementary DNA target with an unlabeled probe of the same sequence. The replacement kinetics were measured using a gel-shift assay for 12, 14 and 16-nucleotide probes as a function of temperature and concentration of the unlabeled probe. The results demonstrate that the overall replacement rate is a combination of two kinetic pathways: dissociative and sequential displacement. The dissociative pathway occurs by the spontaneous dissociation of the initial duplex followed by association of the target and unlabeled probe. The sequential displacement pathway requires only the partial melting of the initial duplex to allow for the formation of a branched nucleation complex with the unlabeled probe, followed by the complete displacement of the labeled probe by migration of the branch point. The contribution from the dissociative pathway is predominant at temperatures close to the melting point of the labeled probe, whereas the contribution from the displacement pathway prevails at lower temperatures and when the concentration of the replacing unlabeled probe is high. The results show that at physiological conditions, duplex formation between a single-stranded oligonucleotide probe and a structured region of a target molecule occurs mainly by the sequential-displacement mechanism.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of many social, technological and economic phenomena are driven by individual human actions, turning the quantitative understanding of human behavior into a central question of modern science. Current models of human dynamics, used from risk assessment to communications, assume that human actions are randomly distributed in time and thus well approximated by Poisson processes. Here we provide direct evidence that for five human activity patterns, such as email and letter based communications, web browsing, library visits and stock trading, the timing of individual human actions follow non-Poisson statistics, characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring events separated by long periods of inactivity. We show that the bursty nature of human behavior is a consequence of a decision based queuing process: when individuals execute tasks based on some perceived priority, the timing of the tasks will be heavy tailed, most tasks being rapidly executed, while a few experiencing very long waiting times. In contrast, priority blind execution is well approximated by uniform interevent statistics. We discuss two queuing models that capture human activity. The first model assumes that there are no limitations on the number of tasks an individual can hadle at any time, predicting that the waiting time of the individual tasks follow a heavy tailed distribution P(τw)∼τ−αw with α=3∕2. The second model imposes limitations on the queue length, resulting in a heavy tailed waiting time distribution characterized by α=1. We provide empirical evidence supporting the relevance of these two models to human activity patterns, showing that while emails, web browsing and library visitation display α=1, the surface mail based communication belongs to the α=3∕2 universality class. Finally, we discuss possible extension of the proposed queuing models and outline some future challenges in exploring the statistical mechanics of human dynamics.},

With the use of a simple dynamical model, it was demonstrated that the cell-cycle network is extremely stable and robust for its function. The biological stationary state, the G1 state, is a global attractor of the dynamics. The biological pathway, the cell-cycle sequence of protein states, is a globally attracting trajectory of the dynamics. These properties are largely preserved with respect to small perturbations to the network. These results suggest that cellular regulatory networks are robustly designed for their functions.},

	abstract = {To facilitate precision medicine and whole-genome annotation, we developed a machine-learning technique that scores how strongly genetic variants affect RNA splicing, whose alteration contributes to many diseases. Analysis of more than 650,000 intronic and exonic variants revealed widespread patterns of mutation-driven aberrant splicing. Intronic disease mutations that are more than 30 nucleotides from any splice site alter splicing nine times as often as common variants, and missense exonic disease mutations that have the least impact on protein function are five times as likely as others to alter splicing. We detected tens of thousands of disease-causing mutations, including those involved in cancers and spinal muscular atrophy. Examination of intronic and exonic variants found using whole-genome sequencing of individuals with autism revealed misspliced genes with neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Our approach provides evidence for causal variants and should enable new discoveries in precision medicine.
INTRODUCTION Advancing whole-genome precision medicine requires understanding how gene expression is altered by genetic variants, especially those that are far outside of protein-coding regions. We developed a computational technique that scores how strongly genetic variants affect RNA splicing, a critical step in gene expression whose disruption contributes to many diseases, including cancers and neurological disorders. A genome-wide analysis reveals tens of thousands of variants that alter splicing and are enriched with a wide range of known diseases. Our results provide insight into the genetic basis of spinal muscular atrophy, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, and autism spectrum disorder.
RATIONALE We used “deep learning” computer algorithms to derive a computational model that takes as input DNA sequences and applies general rules to predict splicing in human tissues. Given a test variant, which may be up to 300 nucleotides into an intron, our model can be used to compute a score for how much the variant alters splicing. The model is not biased by existing disease annotations or population data and was derived in such a way that it can be used to study diverse diseases and disorders and to determine the consequences of common, rare, and even spontaneous variants.
RESULTS Our technique is able to accurately classify disease-causing variants and provides insights into the role of aberrant splicing in disease. We scored more than 650,000 DNA variants and found that disease-causing variants have higher scores than common variants and even those associated with disease in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Our model predicts substantial and unexpected aberrant splicing due to variants within introns and exons, including those far from the splice site. For example, among intronic variants that are more than 30 nucleotides away from any splice site, known disease variants alter splicing nine times as often as common variants; among missense exonic disease variants, those that least affect protein function are more than five times as likely as other variants to alter splicing. Autism has been associated with disrupted splicing in brain regions, so we used our method to score variants detected using whole-genome sequencing data from individuals with and without autism. Genes with high-scoring variants include many that have previously been linked with autism, as well as new genes with known neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Most of the high-scoring variants are intronic and cannot be detected by exome analysis techniques. When we scored clinical variants in spinal muscular atrophy and colorectal cancer genes, up to 94\% of variants found to alter splicing using minigene reporters were correctly classified.
CONCLUSION In the context of precision medicine, causal support for variants independent of existing whole-genome variant studies is greatly needed. Our computational model was trained to predict splicing from DNA sequence alone, without using disease annotations or population data. Consequently, its predictions are independent of and complementary to population data, GWAS, expression-based quantitative trait loci (QTL), and functional annotations of the genome. As such, our technique greatly expands the opportunities for understanding the genetic determinants of disease. View larger version: In this page In a new window Download PowerPoint Slide for Teaching “Deep learning” reveals the genetic origins of disease. A computational system mimics the biology of RNA splicing by correlating DNA elements with splicing levels in healthy human tissues. The system can scan DNA and identify damaging genetic variants, including those deep within introns. This procedure has led to insights into the genetics of autism, cancers, and spinal muscular atrophy.
Predicting defects in RNA splicing
Most eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are spliced to remove introns. Splicing generates uninterrupted open reading frames that can be translated into proteins. Splicing is often highly regulated, generating alternative spliced forms that code for variant proteins in different tissues. RNA-binding proteins that bind specific sequences in the mRNA regulate splicing. Xiong et al. develop a computational model that predicts splicing regulation for any mRNA sequence (see the Perspective by Guigó and Valcárcel). They use this to analyze more than half a million mRNA splicing sequence variants in the human genome. They are able to identify thousands of known disease-causing mutations, as well as many new disease candidates, including 17 new autism-linked genes.

	abstract = {Background: Metabolic abnormalities associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) are caused in part by inadequate insulin action and resulting changes in gene expression in the skeletal muscle. Two recent, independent studies of human skeletal muscle biopsies from ethnically diverse DM2 patients have identified coordinated reductions in the expression of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes. Whether these reductions are a consequence or a cause of impaired insulin sensitivity remains an open question.  Methods: To address this question and to define the underlying molecular causes consistent with the expression changes reported in the muscle studies, we created a large-scale computable model to analyze the molecular actions and effects of insulin on muscle gene expression. The model enables computer-aided reasoning using over 210,000 molecular relationships assembled from the DM2 literature.  Results: We integrated the data from these muscle biopsy studies into the model and used computer-aided causal reasoning to discover mechanisms that can link alterations in OXPHOS genes to decreases in glucose transport, insulin signaling, and risk factors associated to post-transplant diabetes mellitus.  Conclusions: The emerging hypotheses describe biologic effects in DM2 and offer important cues for molecular targeted therapy.},

For modeling approaches that focus on robustness and fragility as unifying concepts, the Internet is an especially attractive case study, mainly because its applications are ubiquitous and pervasive, and widely available expositions exist at every level of detail. Nevertheless, alternative approaches to modeling the Internet often make extremely different assumptions and derive opposite conclusions about fundamental properties of one and the same system. Fortunately, a detailed understanding of Internet technology combined with a unique ability to measure the network means that these differences can be understood thoroughly and resolved unambiguously. This article aims to make recent results of this process accessible beyond Internet specialists to the broader scientific community and to clarify several sources of basic methodological differences that are relevant beyond either the Internet or the two specific approaches focused on here (i.e., scale-free networks and highly optimized tolerance networks).},

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) affects almost 1 million people worldwide per year. Despite therapeutic advances the overall survival rate remains low because diagnosis often occurs only at advanced stages with poor prognosis. Like in most cancers, the implementation of an early detection scheme would have a positive impact on this disease. Similarly, as oral cancer has a very high recurrence rate, the early identification of recurrence or second primary tumors is an important challenge. HNSCC detection is currently based on expert clinical examination of the upper aerodigestive tract and histologic analysis of suspicious areas, but it may be undetectable in hidden sites, and unfortunately visual screening for oral lesions is an often neglected part of dental healthcare. Our group is actively pursuing the assembly of a toolbox for the molecular analysis of oral fluid. Here we present our current status utilizing the salivary transcriptome for oral cancer diagnostics.},

" Chastain et al. (1) suggest that the tradeoff between increasing cumulative fitness and entropy helps us understand the role of sex in evolution. However, this is not so clear, because the MWUA is defined for a single “player,” and so applies equally well to an asexual population. Moreover, Chastain et al.'s (1) analysis is entirely deterministic, and it is known that in the absence of random drift (i.e., in infinitely large populations), recombination is only favored if there are special kinds of interaction between genes (15). Recombination is much more widely favored in finite populations, because it allows the reconstruction of combinations of genes that have been lost by chance; however, results on the deterministic MWUA do not directly address this issue, which is essentially stochastic.

The field may be referred to as mathematical biology or biomathematics to stress the mathematical side, or as theoretical biology to stress the biological side. Mathematical biology aims at the mathematical representation, treatment and modeling of biological processes, using a variety of applied mathematical techniques and tools. It has both theoretical and practical applications in biological, biomedical and biotechnology research. For example, in cell biology, protein interactions are often represented as "cartoon" models, which, although easy to visualize, do not accurately describe the systems studied. In order to do this, precise mathematical models are required. By describing the systems in a quantitative manner, their behavior can be better simulated, and hence properties can be predicted that might not be evident to the experimenter.
Such mathematical areas as calculus, probability theory, statistics, linear algebra, abstract algebra, graph theory, combinatorics, algebraic geometry, topology, dynamical systems, differential equations and coding theory are now being applied in biology. Some mathematical areas, such as certain methodologies in statistics, were developed as tools during the conduct of research into mathematical biology.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the structure and evolution of the protein interaction network of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is analyzed. The network is viewed as a graph whose nodes correspond to proteins. Two proteins are connected by an edge if they interact. The network resembles a random graph in that it consists of many small subnets (groups of proteins that interact with each other but do not interact with any other protein) and one large connected subnet comprising more than half of all interacting proteins. The number of interactions per protein appears to follow a power law distribution. Within approximately 200 Myr after a duplication, the products of duplicate genes become almost equally likely to (1) have common protein interaction partners and (2) be part of the same subnetwork as two proteins chosen at random from within the network. This indicates that the persistence of redundant interaction partners is the exception rather than the rule. After gene duplication, the likelihood that an interaction gets lost exceeds 2.2 × 10−3/Myr. New interactions are estimated to evolve at a rate that is approximately three orders of magnitude smaller. Every 300 Myr, as many as half of all interactions may be replaced by new interactions.},

	abstract = {Author SummaryThe modular organization of cells is not immediately obvious from the network of interacting genes, proteins, and molecules. A new window into cellular modularity is opened up by genetic data that identifies pairs of genes that interact either directly or indirectly to provide robustness to cellular function. Such pairs can map out the modular nature of a network if we understand how they relate to established mathematical clustering methods applied to networks to identify putative modules. We can test the relationship between genetically interacting pairs and modules on artificial data: large networks of interacting proteins and molecules that were evolved within an artificial chemistry and genetics, and that pass the standard tests for biological networks. Modularity evolves in these networks in order to deal with a multitude of functional goals, with a degree depending on environmental variability. Relationships between genetically interacting pairs and modules similar to those displayed by the artificial gene networks are found in the protein–protein interaction network of baker's yeast. The evolution of complex functional biological networks in silico provides an opportunity to develop and test new methods and tools to understand the complexity of biological systems at the network level.},

	abstract = {Recognizing direct relationships between variables connected in a network is a pervasive problem in biological, social and information sciences as correlation-based networks contain numerous indirect relationships. Here we present a general method for inferring direct effects from an observed correlation matrix containing both direct and indirect effects. We formulate the problem as the inverse of network convolution, and introduce an algorithm that removes the combined effect of all indirect paths of arbitrary length in a closed-form solution by exploiting eigen-decomposition and infinite-series sums. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in several network applications: distinguishing direct targets in gene expression regulatory networks; recognizing directly interacting amino-acid residues for protein structure prediction from sequence alignments; and distinguishing strong collaborations in co-authorship social networks using connectivity information alone. In addition to its theoretical impact as a foundational graph theoretic tool, our results suggest network deconvolution is widely applicable for computing direct dependencies in network science across diverse disciplines.

	abstract = {Evolutionary graph theory is an area of research lying at the intersection of graph theory, probability theory, and mathematical biology. Evolutionary graph theory is an approach to studying how topology affects evolution of a population. That the underlying topology can substantially affect the results of the evolutionary process is seen most clearly in a paper by Erez Lieberman, Christoph Hauert and Martin Nowak.
In evolutionary graph theory, individuals occupy vertices of a weighted directed graph and the weight wi j of an edge from vertex i to vertex j denotes the probability of i replacing j. The weight corresponds to the biological notion of fitness where fitter types propagate more readily. One property studied on graphs with two types of individuals is the fixation probability, which is defined as the probability that a single, randomly placed mutant of type A will replace a population of type B. According to the isothermal theorem, a graph has the same fixation probability as the corresponding Moran process if and only if it is isothermal, thus the sum of all weights that lead into a vertex is the same for all vertices. Thus, for example, a complete graph with equal weights describes a Moran process. The fixation probability is

Graphs can be classified into amplifiers of selection and suppressors of selection. If the fixation probability of a single advantageous mutation 
  
    
      
        
          ρ
          
            G
          
        
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}rho \_\{G\}\}
   is higher than the fixation probability of the corresponding Moran process 
  
    
      
        
          ρ
          
            M
          
        
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}rho \_\{M\}\}
   then the graph is an amplifier, otherwise a suppressor of selection. One example of the suppressor of selection is a linear process where only vertex i-1 can replace vertex i (but not the other way around). In this case the fixation probability is 
  
    
      
        
          ρ
          
            G
          
        
        =
        1
        
          /
        
        N
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}rho \_\{G\}=1/N\}
   (where N is the number of vertices) since this is the probability that the mutation arises in the first vertex which will eventually replace all the other ones. Since 
  
    
      
        
          ρ
          
            G

          ρ
          
            M
          
        
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}rho \_\{G\}{\textless}{\textbackslash}rho \_\{M\}\}
   for all r greater than 1, this graph is by definition a suppressor of selection.
Evolutionary graph theory may also be studied in a dual formulation, as a coalescing random walk.
Also evolutionary games can be studied on graphs where again an edge between i and j means that these two individuals will play a game against each other.
Closely related stochastic processes include the voter model, which was introduced by Clifford and Sudbury (1973) and independently by Holley and Liggett (1975), and which has been studied extensively.},

The element of this inter-domain routing system that has attracted the single-most attention within the research community has been the "inter-domain topology". Unfortunately, almost from the get go, the vast majority of studies of this topology, from definition, to measurement, to modeling and analysis, have ignored the central role of BGP in this problem. The legacy is a set of specious findings, unsubstantiated claims, and ill-conceived ideas about the Internet as a whole. By presenting a BGP-focused state-of-the-art treatment of the aspects that are critical for a rigorous study of this inter-domain topology, we demystify in this paper many "controversial" observations reported in the existing literature. At the same time, we illustrate the benefits and richness of new scientific approaches to measuring, modeling, and analyzing the inter-domain topology that are faithful to the BGP-specific nature of this problem domain.},

	abstract = {Power laws and distributions with heavy tails are common features of many complex systems. Examples are the distribution of earthquake magnitudes, solar flare intensities and the sizes of neuronal avalanches. Previously, researchers surmised that a single general concept may act as an underlying generative mechanism, with the theory of self organized criticality being a weighty contender.
The power-law scaling observed in the primary statistical analysis is an important, but by far not the only feature characterizing experimental data. The scaling function, the distribution of energy fluctuations, the distribution of inter-event waiting times, and other higher order spatial and temporal correlations, have seen increased consideration over the last years. Leading to realization that basic models, like the original sandpile model, are often insufficient to adequately describe the complexity of real-world systems with power-law distribution.
Consequently, a substantial amount of effort has gone into developing new and extended models and, hitherto, three classes of models have emerged. The first line of models is based on a separation between the time scales of an external drive and an internal dissipation, and includes the original sandpile model and its extensions, like the dissipative earthquake model. Within this approach the steady state is close to criticality in terms of an absorbing phase transition. The second line of models is based on external drives and internal dynamics competing on similar time scales and includes the coherent noise model, which has a non-critical steady state characterized by heavy-tailed distributions. The third line of models proposes a non-critical self-organizing state, being guided by an optimization principle, such as the concept of highly optimized tolerance.
We present a comparative overview regarding distinct modeling approaches together with a discussion of their potential relevance as underlying generative models for real-world phenomena. The complexity of physical and biological scaling phenomena has been found to transcend the explanatory power of individual paradigmal concepts. The interaction between theoretical development and experimental observations has been very fruitful, leading to a series of novel concepts and insights.},

INTRODUCTIONGenetic interactions occur when mutations in two or more genes combine to generate an unexpected phenotype. An extreme negative or synthetic lethal genetic interaction occurs when two mutations, neither lethal individually, combine to cause cell death. Conversely, positive genetic interactions occur when two mutations produce a phenotype that is less severe than expected. Genetic interactions identify functional relationships between genes and can be harnessed for biological discovery and therapeutic target identification. They may also explain a considerable component of the undiscovered genetics associated with human diseases. Here, we describe construction and analysis of a comprehensive genetic interaction network for a eukaryotic cell.
RATIONALEGenome sequencing projects are providing an unprecedented view of genetic variation. However, our ability to interpret genetic information to predict inherited phenotypes remains limited, in large part due to the extensive buffering of genomes, making most individual eukaryotic genes dispensable for life. To explore the extent to which genetic interactions reveal cellular function and contribute to complex phenotypes, and to discover the general principles of genetic networks, we used automated yeast genetics to construct a global genetic interaction network.
RESULTSWe tested most of the {\textasciitilde}6000 genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for all possible pairwise genetic interactions, identifying nearly 1 million interactions, including {\textasciitilde}550,000 negative and {\textasciitilde}350,000 positive interactions, spanning {\textasciitilde}90\% of all yeast genes. Essential genes were network hubs, displaying five times as many interactions as nonessential genes. The set of genetic interactions or the genetic interaction profile for a gene provides a quantitative measure of function, and a global network based on genetic interaction profile similarity revealed a hierarchy of modules reflecting the functional architecture of a cell. Negative interactions connected functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive interactions often mapped general regulatory connections associated with defects in cell cycle progression or cellular proteostasis. Importantly, the global network illustrates how coherent sets of negative or positive genetic interactions connect protein complex and pathways to map a functional wiring diagram of the cell.
CONCLUSIONA global genetic interaction network highlights the functional organization of a cell and provides a resource for predicting gene and pathway function. This network emphasizes the prevalence of genetic interactions and their potential to compound phenotypes associated with single mutations. Negative genetic interactions tend to connect functionally related genes and thus may be predicted using alternative functional information. Although less functionally informative, positive interactions may provide insights into general mechanisms of genetic suppression or resiliency. We anticipate that the ordered topology of the global genetic network, in which genetic interactions connect coherently within and between protein complexes and pathways, may be exploited to decipher genotype-to-phenotype relationships. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/353/6306/aaf1420/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint A global network of genetic interaction profile similarities.(Left) Genes with similar genetic interaction profiles are connected in a global network, such that genes exhibiting more similar profiles are located closer to each other, whereas genes with less similar profiles are positioned farther apart. (Right) Spatial analysis of functional enrichment was used to identify and color network regions enriched for similar Gene Ontology bioprocess terms.
We generated a global genetic interaction network for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, constructing more than 23 million double mutants, identifying about 550,000 negative and about 350,000 positive genetic interactions. This comprehensive network maps genetic interactions for essential gene pairs, highlighting essential genes as densely connected hubs. Genetic interaction profiles enabled assembly of a hierarchical model of cell function, including modules corresponding to protein complexes and pathways, biological processes, and cellular compartments. Negative interactions connected functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive interactions often mapped general regulatory connections among gene pairs, rather than shared functionality.

In molecular systems, valency describes the number of bonds an atom can make with its neighbors. Larger objects such as colloids can be linked together to make connected structures in which the number of connections, or valency, is controlled by the central object. Jones et al. review the two main approaches to creating stiff bonds, based on DNA-based materials synthesis. These approaches allow the construction of molecular-like objects from building blocks much larger than single atoms.

Structured Abstract
BACKGROUND Nucleic acids are ubiquitous in biology because of their ability to encode vast amounts of information via canonical Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions. With the advent of chemical methods to make synthetic oligonucleotides of an arbitrary sequence, researchers can program entire libraries of molecules with orthogonal interactions, directed to assemble in highly specific arrangements. Early attempts to use DNA to make nanostructures led to topologically defined architectures, but ones that were too conformationally flexible to be used to guide the construction of well-defined nanoscale materials from the bottom up. In this Review, we discuss the key discoveries that have overcome this limitation and distill common design principles that have since led to a revolution in materials sophistication based on DNA-directed assembly.
ADVANCES The experimental realization of DNA-based constructs that are sufficiently rigid so as to impart directionality to hybridization interactions marks a major milestone in the development of programmable materials assembly. This feat was accomplished simultaneously by the Mirkin Group and Seeman Group in 1996, but through chemically and conceptually distinct pathways. In one approach, rigidity is derived from multiple strand crossover events and the hybridization that stabilizes them to create a conformationally restricted DNA tile. In the other approach, a rigid non-nucleic acid–based nanoparticle (inorganic or organic) core acts as a template to organize functionalized DNA strands in a surface-normal orientation. It is appealing to draw the analogy between DNA-based constructs of this sort with the concepts of “bonds” and “valency” found in atomic systems. Just as understanding the nature of atomic bonding is crucial for chemists to manipulate the formation of molecular and supramolecular species, so too is an understanding of the nature of these DNA bonding modes necessary for nanoscientists to build complex and functional architectures to address materials needs.
OUTLOOK The interest in nanoscale materials constructed by using DNA bonds has continued to grow steadily, but has seen a noteworthy explosion in relevance over the past several years. This is due in large part to the development of methods to move beyond simple clusters and crystals to more sophisticated nanostructured materials that are dynamic and stimuli responsive, are macroscopic in spatial extent, and exhibit emergent physical properties that arise from specific arrangements of matter. These techniques offer perhaps the most versatile way of organizing optically active materials into architectures that exhibit unusual and deliberately tailorable plasmonic and photonic properties. In addition, prospects include the use of these materials in biological settings, being that they are constructed, in large measure, from nucleic acid precursors. The ability to manipulate gene expression, deliver molecular payloads via DNA-based binding events, and detect relevant markers of disease with nanoscale spatial resolution represent some of the most fruitful avenues of future research. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/347/6224/1260901/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Differentiating nanoscale DNA bonds. (A) Multiple strand crossover events and DNA hybridization produce a conformationally constrained molecule with a rigid core. (B) A rigid nanoparticle acts as a scaffold for the immobilization and organization of DNA strands in a surface-normal direction.
For over half a century, the biological roles of nucleic acids as catalytic enzymes, intracellular regulatory molecules, and the carriers of genetic information have been studied extensively. More recently, the sequence-specific binding properties of DNA have been exploited to direct the assembly of materials at the nanoscale. Integral to any methodology focused on assembling matter from smaller pieces is the idea that final structures have well-defined spacings, orientations, and stereo-relationships. This requirement can be met by using DNA-based constructs that present oriented nanoscale bonding elements from rigid core units. Here, we draw analogy between such building blocks and the familiar chemical concepts of “bonds” and “valency” and review two distinct but related strategies that have used this design principle in constructing new configurations of matter.},

The rates of these processes can be estimated from available Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome data and are sufficiently high to affect network structure on short time-scales. For instance, more than 100 interactions may be added to the yeast network every million years, a fraction of which adds previously unconnected proteins to the network. Highly connected proteins show a greater rate of interaction turnover than proteins with few interactions. From these observations one can explain (without natural selection on global network structure) the evolutionary sustenance of the most prominent network feature, the distribution of the frequency P(d) of proteins with d neighbours, which is broad-tailed and consistent with a power law, that is: P(d) α d -γ.},

Therefore, it is important to investigate the evolution of biological networks in terms of network rewiring. Understanding how biological networks evolve could eventually help explain the general mechanism of cellular system. In the past decade, a large amount of high-throughput experiments have helped to unravel the different types of networks in a number of species. Recent studies have provided evolutionary rate calculations on individual networks and observed different rewiring rates between them. We have chosen a systematic approach to compare rewiring rate differences among the common types of biological networks utilizing experimental data across species. Our analysis shows that regulatory networks generally evolve faster than non-regulatory collaborative networks. Our analysis also highlights future applications of the approach to address other interesting biological questions.},

In addition, emergent biological features such as complexity, modularity, and evolvability, all of which are current targets of considerable speculation, may be nothing more than indirect by-products of processes operating at lower levels of organization. These issues are examined in the context of the view that the origins of many aspects of biological diversity, from gene-structural embellishments to novelties at the phenotypic level, have roots in nonadaptive processes, with the population-genetic environment imposing strong directionality on the paths that are open to evolutionary exploitation.},

Understanding genotype-phenotype relationships requires that phenotypes be viewed as manifestations of network properties, rather than simply as the result of individual genomic variations. Genome sequencing efforts have identified numerous germline mutations associated with cancer predisposition and large numbers of somatic genomic alterations. However, it remains challenging to distinguish between background, or “passenger” and causal, or “driver” cancer mutations in these datasets. Human viruses intrinsically depend on their host cell during the course of infection and can elicit pathological phenotypes similar to those arising from mutations. To test the hypothesis that genomic variations and tumour viruses may cause cancer via related mechanisms, we systematically examined host interactome and transcriptome network perturbations caused by DNA tumour virus proteins. The resulting integrated viral perturbation data reflects rewiring of the host cell networks, and highlights pathways that go awry in cancer, such as Notch signalling and apoptosis. We show that systematic analyses of host targets of viral proteins can identify cancer genes with a success rate on par with their identification through functional genomics and large-scale cataloguing of tumour mutations. Together, these complementary approaches result in increased specificity for cancer gene identification. Combining systems-level studies of pathogen-encoded gene products with genomic approaches will facilitate prioritization of cancer-causing driver genes so as to advance understanding of the genetic basis of human cancer.},

	abstract = {We describe a simple and robust method to construct complex three-dimensional (3D) structures by using short synthetic DNA strands that we call “DNA bricks.” In one-step annealing reactions, bricks with hundreds of distinct sequences self-assemble into prescribed 3D shapes. Each 32-nucleotide brick is a modular component; it binds to four local neighbors and can be removed or added independently. Each 8–base pair interaction between bricks defines a voxel with dimensions of 2.5 by 2.5 by 2.7 nanometers, and a master brick collection defines a “molecular canvas” with dimensions of 10 by 10 by 10 voxels. By selecting subsets of bricks from this canvas, we constructed a panel of 102 distinct shapes exhibiting sophisticated surface features, as well as intricate interior cavities and tunnels.
Stepwise assembly of 32-nucleotide DNA “bricks” can create a wide variety of nanoscale objects.

It differs from the Negative Binomial Distribution in that lack of success, being a non-event, is not punished by increased chance of failure. It is shown that such a stochastic law is governed by the Beta Function, containing only one free parameter, and this is approximated by a skew or hyperbolic distribution of the type that is widespread in bibliometrics and diverse social science phenomena. In particular, this is shown to be an appropriate underlying probabilistic theory for the Bradford Law, the Lotka Law, the Pareto and Zipf Distributions, and for all the empirical results of citation frequency analysis. As side results one may derive also the obsolescence factor for literature use. The Beta Function is peculiarly elegant for these manifold purposes because it yields both the actual and the cumulative distributions in simple form, and contains a limiting case of an inverse square law to which many empirical distributions conform.},

	abstract = {In situ analysis of biomarkers is highly desirable in molecular pathology because it allows the examination of biomarker status within the histopathological context of clinical specimens. Immunohistochemistry and DNA in situ hybridization (ISH) are widely used in clinical settings to assess protein and DNA biomarkers, respectively, but clinical use of in situ RNA analysis is rare. This disparity is especially notable when considering the abundance of RNA biomarkers discovered through whole-genome expression profiling. This is largely due to the high degree of technical complexity and insufficient sensitivity and specificity of current RNA ISH techniques. Here, we describe RNAscope, a novel RNA ISH technology with a unique probe design strategy that allows simultaneous signal amplification and background suppression to achieve single-molecule visualization while preserving tissue morphology. RNAscope is compatible with routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens and can use either conventional chromogenic dyes for bright-field microscopy or fluorescent dyes for multiplex analysis. Unlike grind-and-bind RNA analysis methods such as real-time RT-PCR, RNAscope brings the benefits of in situ analysis to RNA biomarkers and may enable rapid development of RNA ISH-based molecular diagnostic assays.},

Accordingly, mechanistic understanding of human disease will require understanding of how disease-causing mutations affect systems or interactome properties. The study of 'edgetics' uncovers specific loss or gain of interactions (edges) to interpret genotype-to-phenotype relationships.

	abstract = {Allometry is the study of the relationship of body size to shape, anatomy, physiology and finally behaviour, first outlined by Otto Snell in 1892, D'Arcy Thompson in 1917 in On Growth and Form and Julian Huxley in 1932. Allometry is a well-known study, particularly in statistical shape analysis for its theoretical developments, as well as in biology for practical applications to the differential growth rates of the parts of a living organism's body. One application is in the study of various insect species (e.g., the Hercules Beetle), where a small change in overall body size can lead to an enormous and disproportionate increase in the dimensions of appendages such as legs, antennae, or horns. The relationship between the two measured quantities is often expressed as a power law:
 or in a logarithmic form: 
where  is the scaling exponent of the law. Methods for estimating this exponent from data use type 2 regressions such as major axis regression or reduced major axis regression as these account for the variation in both variables, contrary to least squares regression, which does not account for error variance in the independent variable (e.g., log body mass). Other methods include measurement error models and a particular kind of principal component analysis.
Allometry often studies shape differences in terms of ratios of the objects' dimensions. Two objects of different size but common shape will have their dimensions in the same ratio. Take, for example, a biological object that grows as it matures. Its size changes with age but the shapes are similar. Studies of ontogenetic allometry often use lizards or snakes as model organisms because they lack parental care after birth or hatching and because they exhibit a large range of body size between the juvenile and adult stage. Lizards often exhibit allometric changes during their ontogeny.
In addition to studies that focus on growth, allometry also examines shape variation among individuals of a given age (and sex), which is referred to as static allometry. Comparisons of species are used to examine interspecific or evolutionary allometry (see also Phylogenetic comparative methods).},

We follow by discussing many of the design principles that have been found in genetic, metabolic, and signal transduction circuits. We concentrate mainly on results in the context of Biochemical Systems Theory, although we also briefly discuss other work. We conclude by discussing the importance of these principles for both, understanding the natural evolution of complex networks at the molecular level and for creating artificial biological systems with specific features.},

	abstract = {Despite considerable progress in genome- and proteome-based high-throughput screening methods and in rational drug design, the increase in approved drugs in the past decade did not match the increase of drug development costs. Network description and analysis not only give a systems-level understanding of drug action and disease complexity, but can also help to improve the efficiency of drug design. We give a comprehensive assessment of the analytical tools of network topology and dynamics. The state-of-the-art use of chemical similarity, protein structure, protein–protein interaction, signaling, genetic interaction and metabolic networks in the discovery of drug targets is summarized. We propose that network targeting follows two basic strategies. The “central hit strategy” selectively targets central nodes/edges of the flexible networks of infectious agents or cancer cells to kill them. The “network influence strategy” works against other diseases, where an efficient reconfiguration of rigid networks needs to be achieved by targeting the neighbors of central nodes/edges. It is shown how network techniques can help in the identification of single-target, edgetic, multi-target and allo-network drug target candidates. We review the recent boom in network methods helping hit identification, lead selection optimizing drug efficacy, as well as minimizing side-effects and drug toxicity. Successful network-based drug development strategies are shown through the examples of infections, cancer, metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Summarizing {\textgreater}1200 references we suggest an optimized protocol of network-aided drug development, and provide a list of systems-level hallmarks of drug quality. Finally, we highlight network-related drug development trends helping to achieve these hallmarks by a cohesive, global approach.},

Here we analysed 264 complete genomes from 12 Escherichia coli populations to characterize their dynamics over 50,000 generations. The populations that retained the ancestral mutation rate support a model in which most fixed mutations are beneficial, the fraction of beneficial mutations declines as fitness rises, and neutral mutations accumulate at a constant rate. We also compared these populations to mutation-accumulation lines evolved under a bottlenecking regime that minimizes selection. Nonsynonymous mutations, intergenic mutations, insertions and deletions are overrepresented in the long-term populations, further supporting the inference that most mutations that reached high frequency were favoured by selection. These results illuminate the shifting balance of forces that govern genome evolution in populations adapting to a new environment.},

However, it seems that many of these areas have been relatively closed to outsiders.

	abstract = {Transcription factors bind in a combinatorial fashion to specify the on-and-off states of genes; the ensemble of these binding events forms a regulatory network, constituting the wiring diagram for a cell. To examine the principles of the human transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the genomic binding information of 119 transcription-related factors in over 450 distinct experiments. We found the combinatorial, co-association of transcription factors to be highly context specific: distinct combinations of factors bind at specific genomic locations. In particular, there are significant differences in the binding proximal and distal to genes. We organized all the transcription factor binding into a hierarchy and integrated it with other genomic information (for example, microRNA regulation), forming a dense meta-network. Factors at different levels have different properties; for instance, top-level transcription factors more strongly influence expression and middle-level ones co-regulate targets to mitigate information-flow bottlenecks. Moreover, these co-regulations give rise to many enriched network motifs (for example, noise-buffering feed-forward loops). Finally, more connected network components are under stronger selection and exhibit a greater degree of allele-specific activity (that is, differential binding to the two parental alleles). The regulatory information obtained in this study will be crucial for interpreting personal genome sequences and understanding basic principles of human biology and disease.

A series of studies has identified key principles controlling the growth and the dynamics of scale-free networks. Here, we use neuron-based networks of boolean components as a framework for modelling a large class of dynamical behaviours in both natural and artificial systems. Applying a training algorithm, we characterize how networks with distinct topologies evolve towards a pre-established target function through a process of random mutations and selection. We find that homogeneous random networks and scale-free networks exhibit drastically different evolutionary paths. Whereas homogeneous random networks accumulate neutral mutations and evolve by sparse punctuated steps, scale-free networks evolve rapidly and continuously. Remarkably, this latter property is robust to variations of the degree exponent. In contrast, homogeneous random networks require a specific tuning of their connectivity to optimize their ability to evolve. These results highlight an organizing principle that governs the evolution of complex networks and that can improve the design of engineered systems.},

Here, we examine one of the most basic and intensely-studied structure-to-function relationships observed in cellular networks: that between the number of interactions a protein has and its tendency to be essential. We develop a new computational framework to systematically analyze essential proteins within their cellular context by explicitly incorporating functional information. We apply this framework to the yeast interactome and demonstrate that the previously observed positive relationship between interaction degree and essentiality is largely due to intramodular interactions. Further, essentiality appears to be a modular property of protein complexes and not more broadly of biological processes. Within an essential complex, its essential proteins tend to have more interactions, especially intra-complex interactions, than its non-essential proteins. Finally, in a computationally inferred module-level interaction network, essential complexes and processes tend to have higher interaction degrees than their non-essential counterparts. In summary, we show a relationship between connectivity and essentiality not only at the protein level, but also within modules and at the module level, with complexes and processes that are essential tending to interact with many functional groups.},

The outcome of network inference therefore varies between tools and can be highly complementary. Here we categorize the available tools according to the strategies that they use to deal with the problem of underdetermination.

Studies with computational models, however, have suggested that denser gene networks evolve to be more dynamically robust than sparser networks. We resolve this discrepancy by showing that misassumptions about how to measure robustness in artificial networks have inadvertently discounted the costs of network complexity. We show that when the costs of complexity are taken into account, that robustness implies a parsimonious network structure that is sparsely connected and not unnecessarily complex; and that selection will favor sparse networks when network topology is free to evolve. Because a robust system of heredity is necessary for the adaptive evolution of complex phenotypes, the maintenance of frugal network complexity is likely a crucial design constraint that underlies biological organization.},

	abstract = {Novel protein-coding genes can arise either through re-organization of pre-existing genes or de novo,. Processes involving re-organization of pre-existing genes, notably following gene duplication, have been extensively described,. In contrast, de novo gene birth remains poorly understood, mainly because translation of sequences devoid of genes, or “non-genic” sequences, is expected to produce insignificant polypeptides rather than proteins with specific biological functions,-. Here, we formalize an evolutionary model according to which functional genes evolve de novo through transitory proto-genes generated by widespread translational activity in non-genic sequences. Testing this model at genome-scale in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we detect translation of hundreds of short species-specific open reading frames (ORFs) located in non-genic sequences. These translation events appear to provide adaptive potential, as suggested by their differential regulation upon stress and by signatures of retention by natural selection. In line with our model, we establish that S. cerevisiae ORFs can be placed within an evolutionary continuum ranging from non-genic sequences to genes. We identify {\textasciitilde}1,900 candidate proto-genes among S. cerevisiae ORFs and find that de novo gene birth from such a reservoir may be more prevalent than sporadic gene duplication. Our work illustrates that evolution exploits seemingly dispensable sequences to generate adaptive functional innovation.},

"These articles are always so frustrating. By this logic, if I spend 2 hours coding up a little computer program that can take in some sensory data and do some basic prediction, my computer program is conscious? The reason no one takes new theories about consciousness seriously (this one will be included, just like the 20 others published in the last year) is because they all claim to have “solved” the problem, or at least come up with a “novel” way of looking at the problem, without answering ANY of the hugely difficult mysteries about the true nature of consciousness that anyone in the field ACTUALLY cares about.
I’m not going to spell out all of the questions that need to be answered, there are too many. But you can’t just say “it’s inference!” and think that you’ve contributed anything meaningful to the discussion. The REAL problems (unity, qualia, correlation to biology, causal/non-causal, and dozens more huge mysteries) are never even remotely touched by any of these new theories. Not by Graziano, not by Anil Seth, certainly not by Sean Carroll (it’s a ‘way of talking’?? really??), and not by this theory. This is all stuff that an undergraduate psychology or biology major could come up with, but they don’t write essays about it because they are at least capable understanding their own ignorance on the subject.
Stop giving us theories and start giving us **explanations**. Call it whatever you want! Inference, stories, attractors, complexity, illusion, microtubules, wave function collapse, fairy magic. If your explanation is good, you will be able to **build** a conscious being because your theory works. None of these work (as explanations of consciousness). Incidentally, neither does the current paradigm of machine learning for many of the same reasons - it’s not an explanation, it’s an application of statistics programming."

To examine the principles of the human transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the genomic binding information of 119 transcription-related factors in over 450 distinct experiments. We found the combinatorial, co-association of transcription factors to be highly context specific: distinct combinations of factors bind at specific genomic locations. In particular, there are significant differences in the binding proximal and distal to genes. We organized all the transcription factor binding into a hierarchy and integrated it with other genomic information (for example, microRNA regulation), forming a dense meta-network. Factors at different levels have different properties; for instance, top-level transcription factors more strongly influence expression and middle-level ones co-regulate targets to mitigate information-flow bottlenecks. Moreover, these co-regulations give rise to many enriched network motifs (for example, noise-buffering feed-forward loops). Finally, more connected network components are under stronger selection and exhibit a greater degree of allele-specific activity (that is, differential binding to the two parental alleles). The regulatory information obtained in this study will be crucial for interpreting personal genome sequences and understanding basic principles of human biology and disease.},

	abstract = {Evolvability, the ability of populations to adapt, can evolve through changes in the mechanisms determining genetic variation and in the processes of development. Here we construct and evolve a simple developmental model in which the pleiotropic effects of genes can evolve. We demonstrate that selection in a changing environment favors a specific pattern of variability, and that this favored pattern maximizes evolvability. Our analysis shows that mutant genotypes with higher evolvability are more likely to increase to fixation. We also show that populations of highly evolvable genotypes are much less likely to be invaded by mutants with lower evolvability, and that this dynamic primarily shapes evolvability. We examine several theoretical objections to the evolution of evolvability in light of this result. We also show that this result is robust to the presence or absence of recombination, and explore how nonrandom environmental change can select for a modular pattern of variability.},

	abstract = {A key question in biological systems is whether genetic diversity persists in the long run under evolutionary competition or whether a single dominant genotype emerges. Classic work by Kalmus in 1945 has established that even in simple diploid species (species with two chromosomes) diversity can be guaranteed as long as the heterozygote individuals enjoy a selective advantage. Despite the classic nature of the problem, as we move towards increasingly polymorphic traits (e.g. human blood types) predicting diversity and understanding its implications is still not fully understood. Our key contribution is to establish complexity theoretic hardness results implying that even in the textbook case of single locus diploid models predicting whether diversity survives or not given its fitness landscape is algorithmically intractable. We complement our results by establishing that under randomly chosen fitness landscapes diversity survives with significant probability. Our results are structurally robust along several dimensions (e.g., choice of parameter distribution, different definitions of stability/persistence, restriction to typical subclasses of fitness landscapes). Technically, our results exploit connections between game theory, nonlinear dynamical systems, complexity theory and biology and establish hardness results for predicting the evolution of a deterministic variant of the well known multiplicative weights update algorithm in symmetric coordination games which could be of independent interest.},

Drawing on case studies from engineering-inspired approaches in biology we show how optimality analysis, and other design-related methods, play a specific methodological role that is tangential to the study of adaptation. To account for the role of these reasoning strategies in contemporary biology, we therefore suggest a reevaluation of the connection between design thinking and adaptationism.},

Such a mutually beneficial process is made possible by specific architectural features observed in robust systems.

	abstract = {In the biological sciences, the term bow tie (so called for its shape) is a recent concept that tries to grasp the essence of some operational and functional structures observed in biological organisms and other kinds of complex and self-organizing systems. In general, bow tie architectures refer to ordered and recurrent structures that often underlie complex technological or biological systems, and that are capable of conferring them a balance among efficiency, robustness and evolvability. In other words, bow ties are able to take into account a great diversity of inputs (fanning in to the knot), showing a much smaller diversity in the protocols and processes (the knot) able to elaborate these inputs, and finally an extremely heterogeneous diversity of outputs (fanning out of the bowtie). These architectures thus manage a wide range of inputs through a core (knot) constituted by a limited number of elements. In such structures, inputs are conveyed into a sort of funnel, towards a "synthesis" core, where they can be duly organized, processed and managed by means of protocols [1], and from where, in turn, a variety of outputs, or responses, is propagated.

According to Csete and Doyle, bow ties are able to optimally organize fluxes of mass, energy, signals in an overall structure that forcedly deals with a highly fluctuating and "sloppy" environment. In a biological perspective, a bow tie manages a large fan in of stimuli (input), it accounts for a "compressed" core, and it expresses again a large fan out of possible phenotypes, metabolite products, or –more generally – reusable modules. Bow tie architectures have been observed in the structural organization at different scales of living and evolving organisms (e.g. bacterial metabolism network) as well as in technological and dynamical systems (e.g. the Internet). Bow ties seem to be able to mediate trade-offs among robustness and efficiency, at the same time assuring to the system the capability to evolve. Conversely, the same efficient architecture may be prone and vulnerable to fragilities due to specific changes, perturbations, and focused attacks directed against the core set of modules and protocols. The bow tie architecture is one of several different structures and functioning principles that living matter employs to achieve self-organization and efficient exploitation of available resources.},

Current models of human dynamics, used from risk assessment to communications, assume that human actions are randomly distributed in time and thus well approximated by Poisson processes. In contrast, there is increasing evidence that the timing of many human activities, ranging from communication to entertainment and work patterns, follow non-Poisson statistics, characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring events separated by long periods of inactivity. Here I show that the bursty nature of human behaviour is a consequence of a decision-based queuing process: when individuals execute tasks based on some perceived priority, the timing of the tasks will be heavy tailed, with most tasks being rapidly executed, whereas a few experience very long waiting times. In contrast, random or priority blind execution is well approximated by uniform inter-event statistics. These finding have important implications, ranging from resource management to service allocation, in both communications and retail.},

Because post-genomics research is taking place throughout the tree of life, comparative approaches offer a way for combining data from many organisms to shed light on the evolution and function of biological networks from the gene to the organismal level. Therefore, systems biology can build on decades of theoretical work in evolutionary biology, and at the same time evolutionary biology can use the systems biology approach to go in new uncharted directions. In this study, we present a review of how the post-genomics era is adopting comparative approaches and dynamic system methods to understand the underlying design principles of network evolution and to shape the nascent field of evolutionary systems biology.

Hundreds of researchers have suggested the human relevance of oncogenic mechanisms from the statistical association between gene expression markers of these mechanisms and disease outcome. Such evidence has become easier to obtain recently with the advent of microarray screens and of large public-domain genome-wide expression datasets with patient follow-up. We demonstrated that in breast cancer any set of 100 genes or more selected at random has a 90\% chance to be significantly associated with outcome. Thus, investigators are bound to find an association however whimsical their marker is. For example, we could establish outcome associations for a signature of postprandial laughter and a signature of social defeat in mice. Association was not stronger than expected at random for 28 (60\%) of 47 published breast cancer signatures. The odds of association are 5–17\% with random single gene markers—a finding relevant to older breast cancer studies. We explained these results by showing that much of the breast cancer transcriptome is correlated with proliferation, which integrates most prognostic information in this disease.},

The integration of network analysis and dynamic modeling enables one to investigate the behavior of the underlying system as a whole and to make experimentally testable predictions about less-understood aspects of the processes involved. In this paper, we present a tutorial on the fundamental steps of Boolean modeling of biological regulatory networks. We demonstrate how to infer a Boolean network model from the available experimental data, analyze the network using graph-theoretical measures, and convert it into a predictive dynamic model. For each step, the pitfalls one may encounter and possible ways to circumvent them are also discussed. We illustrate these steps on a toy network as well as in the context of the Drosophila melanogaster segment polarity gene network.},

	abstract = {The “classical” random graph models, in particular G(n,p), are “homogeneous,” in the sense that the degrees (for example) tend to be concentrated around a typical value. Many graphs arising in the real world do not have this property, having, for example, power-law degree distributions. Thus there has been a lot of recent interest in defining and studying “inhomogeneous” random graph models. One of the most studied properties of these new models is their “robustness”, or, equivalently, the “phase transition” as an edge density parameter is varied. For G(n,p), p = c/n, the phase transition at c = 1 has been a central topic in the study of random graphs for well over 40 years. Many of the new inhomogeneous models are rather complicated; although there are exceptions, in most cases precise questions such as determining exactly the critical point of the phase transition are approachable only when there is independence between the edges. Fortunately, some models studied have this property already, and others can be approximated by models with independence. Here we introduce a very general model of an inhomogeneous random graph with (conditional) independence between the edges, which scales so that the number of edges is linear in the number of vertices. This scaling corresponds to the p = c/n scaling for G(n,p) used to study the phase transition; also, it seems to be a property of many large real-world graphs. Our model includes as special cases many models previously studied. We show that, under one very weak assumption (that the expected number of edges is “what it should be”), many properties of the model can be determined, in particular the critical point of the phase transition, and the size of the giant component above the transition. We do this by relating our random graphs to branching processes, which are much easier to analyze. We also consider other properties of the model, showing, for example, that when there is a giant component, it is “stable”: for a typical random graph, no matter how we add or delete o(n) edges, the size of the giant component does not change by more than o(n). © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A key driver of evolvability is the widespread modularity of biological networks—their organization as functional, sparsely connected subunits—but there is no consensus regarding why modularity itself evolved. Although most hypotheses assume indirect selection for evolvability, here we demonstrate that the ubiquitous, direct selection pressure to reduce the cost of connections between network nodes causes the emergence of modular networks. Computational evolution experiments with selection pressures to maximize network performance and minimize connection costs yield networks that are significantly more modular and more evolvable than control experiments that only select for performance. These results will catalyse research in numerous disciplines, such as neuroscience and genetics, and enhance our ability to harness evolution for engineering purposes.},

	abstract = {Whether by virtue of being prepared in a slowly relaxing, high-free energy initial condition, or because they are constantly dissipating energy absorbed from a strong external drive, many systems subject to thermal fluctuations are not expected to behave in the way they would at thermal equilibrium. Rather, the probability of finding such a system in a given microscopic arrangement may deviate strongly from the Boltzmann distribution, raising the question of whether thermodynamics still has anything to tell us about which arrangements are the most likely to be observed. In this work, we build on past results governing nonequilibrium thermodynamics and define a generalized Helmholtz free energy that exactly delineates the various factors that quantitatively contribute to the relative probabilities of different outcomes in far-from-equilibrium stochastic dynamics. By applying this expression to the analysis of two examples—namely, a particle hopping in an oscillating energy landscape and a population composed of two types of exponentially growing self-replicators—we illustrate a simple relationship between outcome-likelihood and dissipative history. In closing, we discuss the possible relevance of such a thermodynamic principle for our understanding of self-organization in complex systems, paying particular attention to a possible analogy to the way evolutionary adaptations emerge in living things.},

Drawing on case studies from engineering-inspired approaches in biology we show how optimality analysis, and other design-related methods, play a specific methodological role that is tangential to the study of adaptation. To account for the role of these reasoning strategies in contemporary biology, we therefore suggest a reevaluation of the connection between design thinking and adaptationism.},

However, it is not clear that the model assumptions hold for the protein interaction network. Using a cross-genome comparison, we show that (a) the older a protein, the better connected it is, and (b) the number of interactions a protein gains during its evolution is proportional to its connectivity. Therefore, preferential attachment governs the protein network evolution. Evolutionary mechanisms leading to such preference and some implications are discussed.},

Despite a decade of extensive studies, network reconstruction remains an outstanding challenge. The fundamental limitations governing which properties of the interaction matrix (e.g. adjacency pattern, sign pattern or degree sequence) can be inferred from given temporal data of individual nodes remain unknown. Here, we rigorously derive the necessary conditions to reconstruct any property of the interaction matrix. Counterintuitively, we find that reconstructing any property of the interaction matrix is generically as difficult as reconstructing the interaction matrix itself, requiring equally informative temporal data. Revealing these fundamental limitations sheds light on the design of better network reconstruction algorithms that offer practical improvements over existing methods.},

Just as reference genome sequences revolutionized human genetics, reference maps of interactome networks will be critical to fully understand genotype-phenotype relationships. Here, we describe a systematic map of ∼14,000 high-quality human binary protein-protein interactions. At equal quality, this map is ∼30\% larger than what is available from small-scale studies published in the literature in the last few decades. While currently available information is highly biased and only covers a relatively small portion of the proteome, our systematic map appears strikingly more homogeneous, revealing a “broader” human interactome network than currently appreciated. The map also uncovers significant interconnectivity between known and candidate cancer gene products, providing unbiased evidence for an expanded functional cancer landscape, while demonstrating how high-quality interactome models will help “connect the dots” of the genomic revolution.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing has a crucial role in the generation of biological complexity, and its misregulation is often involved in human disease. Here we describe the assembly of a ‘splicing code’, which uses combinations of hundreds of RNA features to predict tissue-dependent changes in alternative splicing for thousands of exons. The code determines new classes of splicing patterns, identifies distinct regulatory programs in different tissues, and identifies mutation-verified regulatory sequences. Widespread regulatory strategies are revealed, including the use of unexpectedly large combinations of features, the establishment of low exon inclusion levels that are overcome by features in specific tissues, the appearance of features deeper into introns than previously appreciated, and the modulation of splice variant levels by transcript structure characteristics. The code detected a class of exons whose inclusion silences expression in adult tissues by activating nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay, but whose exclusion promotes expression during embryogenesis. The code facilitates the discovery and detailed characterization of regulated alternative splicing events on a genome-wide scale.

Not only can it be solved in pseudo-polynomial time, but also decades of algorithmic improvements have made it possible to solve nearly all standard instances from the literature. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of all recent exact solution approaches, and to show that the knapsack problem still is hard to solve for these algorithms for a variety of new test problems. These problems are constructed either by using standard benchmark instances with larger coefficients, or by introducing new classes of instances for which most upper bounds perform badly. The first group of problems challenge the dynamic programming algorithms while the other group of problems are focused towards branch-and-bound algorithms. Numerous computational experiments with all recent state-of-the-art codes are used to show that (KP) is still difficult to solve for a wide number of problems. One could say that the previous benchmark tests were limited to a few highly structured instances, which do not show the full characteristics of knapsack problems.},

Through a new empirical quality control framework, we show that the resulting data set (Worm Interactome 2007, or WI-2007) was similar in quality to low-throughput data curated from the literature. We filtered previous interaction data sets and integrated them with WI-2007 to generate a high-confidence consolidated map (Worm Interactome version 8, or WI8). This work allowed us to estimate the size of the worm interactome at ∼116,000 interactions.

	abstract = {Current yeast interactome network maps contain several hundred molecular complexes with limited and somewhat controversial representation of direct binary interactions. We carried out a comparative quality assessment of current yeast interactome data sets, demonstrating that high-throughput yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening provides high-quality binary interaction information. Because a large fraction of the yeast binary interactome remains to be mapped, we developed an empirically controlled mapping framework to produce a “second-generation” high-quality, high-throughput Y2H data set covering ∼20\% of all yeast binary interactions. Both Y2H and affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP/MS) data are of equally high quality but of a fundamentally different and complementary nature, resulting in networks with different topological and biological properties. Compared to co-complex interactome models, this binary map is enriched for transient signaling interactions and intercomplex connections with a highly significant clustering between essential proteins. Rather than correlating with essentiality, protein connectivity correlates with genetic pleiotropy.
Comparison of existing methods for mapping protein-protein interactions in yeast cells shows that the high-throughput approaches are complementary to one another.

	abstract = {Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is of fundamental importance to numerous biological processes. Nowadays, an increasing amount of gene regulatory relationships have been documented in various databases and literature. However, to more efficiently exploit such knowledge for biomedical research and applications, it is necessary to construct a genome-wide regulatory network database to integrate the information on gene regulatory relationships that are widely scattered in many different places. Therefore, in this work, we build a knowledge-based database, named ‘RegNetwork’, of gene regulatory networks for human and mouse by collecting and integrating the documented regulatory interactions among transcription factors (TFs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and target genes from 25 selected databases. Moreover, we also inferred and incorporated potential regulatory relationships based on transcription factor binding site (TFBS) motifs into RegNetwork. As a result, RegNetwork contains a comprehensive set of experimentally observed or predicted transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory relationships, and the database framework is flexibly designed for potential extensions to include gene regulatory networks for other organisms in the future. Based on RegNetwork, we characterized the statistical and topological properties of genome-wide regulatory networks for human and mouse, we also extracted and interpreted simple yet important network motifs that involve the interplays between TF-miRNA and their targets. In summary, RegNetwork provides an integrated resource on the prior information for gene regulatory relationships, and it enables us to further investigate context-specific transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory interactions based on domain-specific experimental data.Database URL : http://www.regnetworkweb.org},

If, as is often the case, experiments are underpowered, you will be wrong most of the time. This conclusion is demonstrated from several points of view. First, tree diagrams which show the close analogy with the screening test problem. Similar conclusions are drawn by repeated simulations of t-tests. These mimic what is done in real life, which makes the results more persuasive. The simulation method is used also to evaluate the extent to which effect sizes are over-estimated, especially in underpowered experiments. A script is supplied to allow the reader to do simulations themselves, with numbers appropriate for their own work. It is concluded that if you wish to keep your false discovery rate below 5\%, you need to use a three-sigma rule, or to insist on p≤0.001. And never use the word ‘significant’.},

	abstract = {In computational complexity and optimization the no free lunch theorem is a result that states that for certain types of mathematical problems, the computational cost of finding a solution, averaged over all problems in the class, is the same for any solution method. No solution therefore offers a 'short cut'. In computing, there are circumstances in which the outputs of all procedures solving a particular type of problem are statistically identical. A colourful way of describing such a circumstance, introduced by David Wolpert and William G. Macready in connection with the problems of search and optimization, is to say that there is no free lunch. Wolpert had previously derived no free lunch theorems for machine learning (statistical inference). Before Wolpert's article was published, Cullen Schaffer had summarized a preprint version of this work of Wolpert's, but used different terminology. In the "no free lunch" metaphor, each "restaurant" (problem-solving procedure) has a "menu" associating each "lunch plate" (problem) with a "price" (the performance of the procedure in solving the problem). The menus of restaurants are identical except in one regard – the prices are shuffled from one restaurant to the next. For an omnivore who is as likely to order each plate as any other, the average cost of lunch does not depend on the choice of restaurant. But a vegan who goes to lunch regularly with a carnivore who seeks economy might pay a high average cost for lunch. To methodically reduce the average cost, one must use advance knowledge of a) what one will order and b) what the order will cost at various restaurants. That is, improvement of performance in problem-solving hinges on using prior information to match procedures to problems. In formal terms, there is no free lunch when the probability distribution on problem instances is such that all problem solvers have identically distributed results. In the case of search, a problem instance is an objective function, and a result is a sequence of values obtained in evaluation of candidate solutions in the domain of the function. For typical interpretations of results, search is an optimization process. There is no free lunch in search if and only if the distribution on objective functions is invariant under permutation of the space of candidate solutions. This condition does not hold precisely in practice, but an "(almost) no free lunch" theorem suggests that it holds approximately.},

In the past few years many experiments showed that tumor-associated alterations can be detected at the DNA and RNA level. At the DNA level the detection of point mutations, microsatellite alterations, chromosomal alterations, i.e. inversion and deletion, and hypermethylation of promoter sequences were demonstrated. At the RNA level the overexpression of tumor-associated genes was shown.

The model describes how the trade-offs arise from individual parameters, including the interplay of feedback control with autocatalysis of network products necessary to power and catalyze intermediate reactions. We then use control theory to prove that the essential features of these hard trade-off “laws” are universal and fundamental, in that they depend minimally on the details of this system and generalize to the robust efficiency of any autocatalytic network. The theory also suggests worst-case conditions that are consistent with initial experiments. Gylcolytic oscillations in yeast are a by-product of a trade-off between robustness and efficiency.

There have been significant efforts in conceiving parallel-computation approaches in the past, for example: DNA computation, quantum computation, and microfluidics-based computation. However, these approaches have not proven, so far, to be scalable and practical from a fabrication and operational perspective. Here, we report the foundations of an alternative parallel-computation system in which a given combinatorial problem is encoded into a graphical, modular network that is embedded in a nanofabricated planar device. Exploring the network in a parallel fashion using a large number of independent, molecular-motor-propelled agents then solves the mathematical problem. This approach uses orders of magnitude less energy than conventional computers, thus addressing issues related to power consumption and heat dissipation. We provide a proof-of-concept demonstration of such a device by solving, in a parallel fashion, the small instance \{2, 5, 9\} of the subset sum problem, which is a benchmark NP-complete problem. Finally, we discuss the technical advances necessary to make our system scalable with presently available technology.},

	abstract = {Modularity is known to be one of the most relevant characteristics of biological systems and appears to be present at multiple scales. Given its adaptive potential, it is often assumed to be the target of selective pressures. Under such interpretation, selection would be actively favouring the formation of modular structures, which would specialize in different functions. Here we show that, within the context of cellular networks, no such selection pressure is needed to obtain modularity. Instead, the intrinsic dynamics of network growth by duplication and diversification is able to generate it for free and explain the statistical features exhibited by small subgraphs. The implications for the evolution and evolvability of both biological and technological systems are discussed.},

	url = {http://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/7428/},
	abstract = {The resilient, ancient, and fine-tuned DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) has inspired many researchers to harness its power for material purposes. In this work, we use synthesized DNA strands to compute the solution to an instance of edge-matching puzzles (EMP), where the challenge is to pack a collection of edge-coloured square tiles on a square board such that all adjacent edges match in colour. We encode tiles with DNA strands and make use of structural, chemical and enzymatic properties of DNA to effectively carry out a brute-force search of the solution to the puzzle. The solution ultimately results as a 2-dimensional DNA lattice encoding the position and orientation of each tile on the solution board. Our approach has been to represent a tile as the union of two half-tiles. This conceptual representation allows for the use of a supremely powerful heuristic: polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can be inserted at any step of the protocol to selectively amplify certain strands to exponential quantities. Our abstract formalization of half-tiles and the DNA protocol we use to manipulate them have relevance in three ways. First, by solving an instance of the (NP-Complete) EMP problem we make precise characterizations of the processing power of DNA Computing. Second, the 2- dimensional self-assembly of half-tiles is Turing-complete. Thirdly, the 2-dimensional self- assembly of half-tiles can serve as a PCR-powered model for massive nano-scale fabrication of 2- dimensional DNA nano-shapes.},

Man-made computers are made from silicon chips, whereas natural 'computers', such as the brain, use cells and molecules. Computation also occurs on a much smaller scale in regulatory and signalling pathways in individual cells and even within single biomolecules. Indeed, much of what we recognize as life results from the remarkable capacity of biological building blocks to compute in highly sophisticated ways. Rational design and engineering of biological computing systems can greatly enhance our ability to study and to control biological systems. Potential applications include tissue engineering and regeneration and medical treatments. This Review introduces key concepts and discusses recent progress that has been made in biomolecular computing.},

Ideally, when an algorithm is developed for specific problems, the boundaries of its performance should be clear, and we expect estimates of reasonably good performance within and (at least modestly) outside its ‘seen’ instance distribution. However, we show that these ideals are highly over-optimistic, and suggest that standard algorithm-choice scenarios will rarely lead to the best algorithm for individual instances in the space of interest. We do this by examining algorithm ‘footprints’, indicating how performance generalises in instance space. We find much evidence that typical ways of choosing the ‘best’ algorithm, via tests over a distribution of instances, are seriously flawed. Also, understanding how footprints in instance spaces vary between algorithms and across instance space dimensions, may lead to a future platform for wiser algorithm-choice decisions.},

We present the results of the first in-depth study of the structure of Java programs. We have collected a number of Java programs and measured their key structural attributes. We have found evidence that some relationships follow power-laws, while others do not. We have also observed variations that seem related to some characteristic of the application itself.

We report a whole-cell computational model of the life cycle of the human pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium that includes all of its molecular components and their interactions. An integrative approach to modeling that combines diverse mathematics enabled the simultaneous inclusion of fundamentally different cellular processes and experimental measurements. Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions. We conclude that comprehensive whole-cell models can be used to facilitate biological discovery.},

We survey the main modeling efforts in this direction, emphasize the applicability and benefits of executable models in biological research and highlight some of the challenges that executable biology poses for biology and computer science. We claim that for executable biology to reach its full potential as a mainstream biological technique, formal and algorithmic approaches must be integrated into biological research.

The results reported in a recent Computers and Operations Research paper comparing the performance of graph coloring heuristics are revisited with this new methodology to demonstrate (i) how pockets of the instance space can be found where algorithm performance varies significantly from the average performance of an algorithm; (ii) how the properties of the instances can be used to predict algorithm performance on previously unseen instances with high accuracy; and (iii) how the relative strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm can be visualized and measured objectively.},

	abstract = {In graph theory, a dominating set for a graph G = (V, E) is a subset D of V such that every vertex not in D is adjacent to at least one member of D. The domination number γ(G) is the number of vertices in a smallest dominating set for G. The dominating set problem concerns testing whether γ(G) ≤ K for a given graph G and input K; it is a classical NP-complete decision problem in computational complexity theory (Garey \& Johnson 1979). Therefore it is believed that there is no efficient algorithm that finds a smallest dominating set for a given graph. Figures (a)–(c) on the right show three examples of dominating sets for a graph. In each example, each white vertex is adjacent to at least one red vertex, and it is said that the white vertex is dominated by the red vertex. The domination number of this graph is 2: the examples (b) and (c) show that there is a dominating set with 2 vertices, and it can be checked that there is no dominating set with only 1 vertex for this graph.},

In this chapter, we briefly review the dynamical aspects of models of regulatory networks, discussing their most salient features, and we also show how these models can give clues about the way in which networks may organize their capacity to evolve, by providing simple examples of the implementation of robustness and modularity.},

It is closely related to the concept of preferential attachment in network science, where the more connected nodes are destined to acquire many more links in the future than the auxiliary nodes. Cumulative advantage and success-breads-success also both describe the fact that advantage tends to beget further advantage. The concept is behind the many power laws and scaling behaviour in empirical data, and it is at the heart of self-organization across social and natural sciences. Here, we review the methodology for measuring preferential attachment in empirical data, as well as the observations of the Matthew effect in patterns of scientific collaboration, socio-technical and biological networks, the propagation of citations, the emergence of scientific progress and impact, career longevity, the evolution of common English words and phrases, as well as in education and brain development. We also discuss whether the Matthew effect is due to chance or optimization, for example related to homophily in social systems or efficacy in technological systems, and we outline possible directions for future research.},

	abstract = {The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a powerful method for amplification of DNA segments between two regions of known sequences (1, 2). In standard PCR, sequences bound by two unique oligonucleotide primers can be exponentially amplified. However, it is a prerequisite to know the DNA sequence at both ends of the region of interest. To amplify regions of unknown sequence, methods such as inverted PCR (3), Alu PCR (4), and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (5), also known as anchored PCR (6) or one‐sided PCR (7), have been developed. These methods require several enzymatic manipulations of DNA that are either tedious or only suitable for certain conditions. While using standard PCR for in vitro amplification of 5′ untranslated cDNA sequence of acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) mRNA, we observed amplification of a second specific fragment in addition to the expected fragment. Sequence analysis showed that the additional fragment resulted from binding of the 5′ primer to a region that has an imperfect match to the actual primer binding site. Comparing the sequences of the primer (HBGF 1201) and the binding site revealed that only eight out of 32 nucleotides matched (Fig. 1A). Those eight nucleotides cluster in the 19 nucleotides at the 3′ end of the primer and therefore provided priming that allowed for a specific amplified product. With this observation, we reasoned that a single primer could be used, binding both to the complementary sequence},

	abstract = {Expression of the Drosophila segment polarity genes is initiated by a pre-pattern of pair-rule gene products and maintained by a network of regulatory interactions throughout several stages of embryonic development. Analysis of a model of gene interactions based on differential equations showed that wild-type expression patterns of these genes can be obtained for a wide range of kinetic parameters, which suggests that the steady states are determined by the topology of the network and the type of regulatory interactions between components, not the detailed form of the rate laws. To investigate this, we propose and analyse a Boolean model of this network which is based on a binary ON/OFF representation of mRNA and protein levels, and in which the interactions are formulated as logical functions. In this model the spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression are determined by the topology of the network and whether components are present or absent, rather than the absolute levels of the mRNAs and proteins and the functional details of their interactions. The model is able to reproduce the wild-type gene expression patterns, as well as the ectopic expression patterns observed in overexpression experiments and various mutants. Furthermore, we compute explicitly all steady states of the network and identify the basin of attraction of each steady state. The model gives important insights into the functioning of the segment polarity gene network, such as the crucial role of the wingless and sloppy paired genes, and the network's ability to correct errors in the pre-pattern.},

Network biology has emerged as an integrative and systems-level approach for the interpretation of genome data in the context of health and disease. Network biology can provide insightful models for genetic phenomena such as penetrance, epistasis, and modes of inheritance, all of which are integral aspects of Mendelian and complex diseases. Moreover, it can shed light on disease mechanisms via the identification of modules perturbed in those diseases. Current challenges include understanding disease as a result of the interplay between environmental and genetic perturbations and assessing the impact of personal sequence variations in the context of networks. Full realization of the potential of personal genomics will benefit from network biology approaches that aim to uncover the mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis, identify new biomarkers, and guide personalized therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {Author Summary We discovered a large protein network that regulates fat storage in budding yeast. This network contains 94 proteins, almost all of which bind to other proteins in the network. To understand the functions of large protein collections such as these, it will be necessary to move away from one-by-one analysis of individual proteins and create computational models of entire networks. This will allow classification of networks into categories and permit researchers to identify key network proteins on theoretical grounds. We show here that the fat regulation network fits a Watts-Strogatz small-world model. This model was devised to explain the clustering phenomena often observed in real networks, but has not been previously applied to signaling networks within cells. The short path length and high clustering coefficients characteristic of the Watts-Strogatz topology allow for rapid communication between distant nodes and for division of the network into modules that perform different functions. The fat regulation network has modules, and it is divisible into subnetworks that span modular boundaries and regulate different aspects of fat metabolism. We experimentally examined communication between nodes within the network using a combination of genetics and pharmacology, and showed that the communication patterns are consistent with the Watts-Strogatz topology.},

	abstract = {Summary Many signaling systems show adaptation—the ability to reset themselves after responding to a stimulus. We computationally searched all possible three-node enzyme network topologies to identify those that could perform adaptation. Only two major core topologies emerge as robust solutions: a negative feedback loop with a buffering node and an incoherent feedforward loop with a proportioner node. Minimal circuits containing these topologies are, within proper regions of parameter space, sufficient to achieve adaptation. More complex circuits that robustly perform adaptation all contain at least one of these topologies at their core. This analysis yields a design table highlighting a finite set of adaptive circuits. Despite the diversity of possible biochemical networks, it may be common to find that only a finite set of core topologies can execute a particular function. These design rules provide a framework for functionally classifying complex natural networks and a manual for engineering networks.

The network that regulates the mitotic entry of the cell-cycle in eukaryotes also makes a decision before it induces early mitotic processes. Here we show that the switch from inactive to active forms of the mitosis promoting Cyclin Dependent Kinases is driven by a system that is related to both the structure and the dynamics of the Approximate Majority computation. We investigate the behavior of these two switches by deterministic, stochastic and probabilistic methods and show that the steady states and temporal dynamics of the two systems are similar and they are exchangeable as components of oscillatory networks.},

	abstract = {Recent efforts to develop a universal view of complex networks have created both excitement and confusion about the way in which knowledge of network structure can be used to understand, control, or design system behavior. This paper offers perspective on the emerging field of “network science” in three ways. First, it briefly summarizes the origins, methodological approaches, and most celebrated contributions within this increasingly popular field. Second, it contrasts the predominant perspective in the network science literature (that abstracts away domain-specific function and instead focuses on graph-theoretic measures of system structure and dynamics) with that of engineers and practitioners of decision science (who emphasize the importance of network performance, constraints, and trade-offs). Third, it proposes optimization-based reverse engineering to address some important open questions within network science from an operations research perspective. We advocate for increased, yet cautious, participation in this field by operations researchers.},

	abstract = {Many complex systems display a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. For example, relatively simple organisms grow, persist and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions, an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic network. Complex communication networks display a surprising degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. Here we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks, which include the World-Wide Web, the Internet, social networks and cells. We find that such networks display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected even by unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity). Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties of communication networks.},

We characterize the performance, data requirements and inherent biases of different inference approaches, and we provide guidelines for algorithm application and development. We observed that no single inference method performs optimally across all data sets. In contrast, integration of predictions from multiple inference methods shows robust and high performance across diverse data sets. We thereby constructed high-confidence networks for E. coli and S. aureus, each comprising {\textasciitilde}1,700 transcriptional interactions at a precision of {\textasciitilde}50\%. We experimentally tested 53 previously unobserved regulatory interactions in E. coli, of which 23 (43\%) were supported. Our results establish community-based methods as a powerful and robust tool for the inference of transcriptional gene regulatory networks.},

	abstract = {The capacity of cells and organisms to respond to challenging conditions in a repeatable manner is limited by a finite repertoire of pre-evolved adaptive responses. Beyond this capacity, cells can use exploratory dynamics to cope with a much broader array of conditions. However, the process of adaptation by exploratory dynamics within the lifetime of a cell is not well understood. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of exploratory adaptation in a high-dimensional network model of gene regulation. Exploration is initiated by failure to comply with a constraint and is implemented by random sampling of network configurations. It ceases if and when the network reaches a stable state satisfying the constraint. We find that successful convergence (adaptation) in high dimensions requires outgoing network hubs and is enhanced by their auto-regulation. The ability of these empirically validated features of gene regulatory networks to support exploratory adaptation without fine-tuning, makes it plausible for biological implementation., Recent works suggest that cellular networks may respond to novel challenges on the time-scale of cellular lifetimes through large-scale perturbation of gene expression and convergence to a new state. Here, the authors demonstrate the theoretical feasibility of exploratory adaptation in cellular networks by showing that convergence to new states depends on known features of these networks.},

Two central and related questions can be posed in regard to modularity: How does modularity appear in the first place, and what forces are responsible for keeping and/or changing modular patterns? We approached these questions using a quantitative genetics simulation framework, building on previous results obtained with bivariate systems and extending them to multivariate systems. We developed an individual-based model capable of simulating many traits controlled by many loci with variable pleiotropic relations between them, expressed in populations subject to mutation, recombination, drift, and selection. We used this model to study the problem of the emergence of modularity, and hereby show that drift and stabilizing selection are inefficient at creating modular variational structures. We also demonstrate that directional selection can have marked effects on the modular structure between traits, actively promoting a restructuring of genetic variation in the selected population and potentially facilitating the response to selection. Furthermore, we give examples of complex covariation created by simple regimes of combined directional and stabilizing selection and show that stabilizing selection is important in the maintenance of established covariation patterns. Our results are in full agreement with previous results for two-trait systems and further extend them to include scenarios of greater complexity. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary consequences of modular patterns being molded by directional selection.},

Many challenging open problems, such as the Haldane conjecture, the question of the existence of gapped topological spin liquid phases, and the Yang–Mills gap conjecture, concern spectral gaps. These and other problems are particular cases of the general spectral gap problem: given the Hamiltonian of a quantum many-body system, is it gapped or gapless? Here we prove that this is an undecidable problem. Specifically, we construct families of quantum spin systems on a two-dimensional lattice with translationally invariant, nearest-neighbour interactions, for which the spectral gap problem is undecidable. This result extends to undecidability of other low-energy properties, such as the existence of algebraically decaying ground-state correlations. The proof combines Hamiltonian complexity techniques with aperiodic tilings, to construct a Hamiltonian whose ground state encodes the evolution of a quantum phase-estimation algorithm followed by a universal Turing machine. The spectral gap depends on the outcome of the corresponding ‘halting problem’. Our result implies that there exists no algorithm to determine whether an arbitrary model is gapped or gapless, and that there exist models for which the presence or absence of a spectral gap is independent of the axioms of mathematics.

This question has been raised before and resolved in favour of 3/4. Like previous ones, recent claims for a value of 2/3 are based almost entirely on basal metabolic rate (BMR) in mammals. * 2Here we compile and analyse a new, larger data set for mammalian BMR. We show that interspecific variation in BMR, as well as field metabolic rates of mammals, and basal or standard metabolic rates for many other organisms, including vertebrates, invertebrates, protists and plants, all scale with exponents whose confidence intervals include 3/4 and exclude 2/3. Our analysis of maximal metabolic rate gives a slope that is greater than and confidence intervals that exclude both 3/4 and 2/3. * 3Additionally, numerous other physiological rates that are closely tied to metabolism in a wide variety of organisms, including heart and respiratory rates in mammals, scale as M−1/4. * 4The fact that quarter-power allometric scaling is so pervasive in biology suggests that different allometric relations have a common, mechanistic origin and provides an empirical basis for theoretical models that derive these scaling exponents.},

(1997, 1999a).   Renewed interest in allometry is due at least in part to recent theories that purport to explain the quarter-power scaling (West, Brown \& Enquist 1997, 1999a; Banavar, Maritan \& Rinaldo 1999; Banavar et al. 2002). These theories derive the scaling for metabolic rate based on the designs of resource distribution networks, such as animal and plant vascular systems. In particular, the model of West et al. assumes that these networks have three properties: (1) they branch hierarchically to supply all parts of three dimensional organisms; (2) they have terminal units, such as capillaries or petioles, that do not vary with body size; and (3) natural selection has optimized hydrodynamic flow through the network so that the work required to distribute resources has been minimized. This model predicts many other characteristics of plant and animal circulatory systems, including dimensions of vessels, total volume of fluid, rates of flow and delivery times. This model has been extended to explain the quarter-power scaling of many biological traits, including mitochondrial densities (West, Woodruff \& Brown 2002), ontogenetic growth rates (West, Brown \& Enquist 2001), the partitioning and allocation of production between plant organs such as roots, stems, leaves, and reproductive structures (Enquist \& Niklas 2002; Niklas \& Enquist 2002), times of life-history events (Gillooly et al. 2002; Savage et al. 2004), and population growth rates (Savage et al. 2004).},

We argue that progress in understanding the processes of network evolution is only possible when hypotheses are formulated as plausible evolutionary models and compared against the observed data within the framework of probabilistic modeling. The value of such models is expected to be greatly enhanced as they incorporate more of the details of the biophysical properties of interacting proteins, gene phylogeny, and measurement error and as more advanced methodologies emerge for model comparison and the inference of ancestral network states.},

Each gene, in turn, must be expressed at the proper time and in the proper amounts to ensure the appropriate functional outcome. The regulation and expression of some genes are highly robust; their expression is controlled by invariable expression programs. For instance, developmental gene expression is extremely similar in a given cell type from one individual to another. The expression of other genes is more variable: Their levels are noisy and are different from cell to cell and from individual to individual. This can be highly beneficial in physiological responses to outside cues and stresses. Recent advances have enabled the analysis of differential gene expression at a systems level. Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) involving interactions between large numbers of genes and their regulators have been mapped onto graphic diagrams that are used to visualize the regulatory relationships. The further characterization of GRNs has already uncovered global principles of gene regulation. Together with synthetic network biology, such studies are starting to provide insights into the transcriptional mechanisms that cause robust versus stochastic gene expression and their relationships to phenotypic robustness and variability. Here, we discuss GRNs and their topological properties in relation to transcriptional and phenotypic outputs in development and organismal physiology.},

In this paper we propose a general framework which can be used to decrease the time and space complexity of these algorithms with a logarithmic factor. The framework is based on word encoding, i.e. by representing subsolutions as bits in an integer. In this way word parallelism can be used in the evaluation of the dynamic programming recursion. Using this encoding the subset-sum problem can be solved in O( n b/ log b) time and O(b/ log b) space, where n is the number of integers given and b is the target sum. The knapsack problem can be solved in O( n m/ log m) time and O(m/ log m) space, where n is the number of items and m = max\{b,z\} is the maximum of the capacity b and the optimal solution value z . The problem of finding a path of a given length b in a directed acyclic graph G=(V,E) can be solved in O(textbarEtextbarb/ log b) time and O(textbarVtextbarb/ log b) space. Several other examples are given showing the generality of the achieved technique. Extensive computational experiments are provided to demonstrate that the achieved results are not only of theoretical interest but actually lead to algorithms which are up to two orders of magnitude faster than their predecessors. This is a surprising observation as the increase in speed is larger than the word size of the processor.},

This counter is an n-bit binary reflecting Gray code counter that advances through 2n states. In the strand displacement realization of this counter, the waste—total number of nucleotides of the DNA strands consumed—is polynomial in n, the number of bits of the counter, while the waste of alternative counters grows exponentially in n. We also show that our n-bit counter fails to work correctly when many (Θ(n)) copies of the species that represent the bits of the counter are present initially. The proof applies more generally to show that in chemical reaction systems where all but one reactant of each reaction are catalysts, computations longer than a polynomial function of the size of the system are not possible when there are polynomially many copies of the system present.},

	abstract = {Summary While alternative splicing is known to diversify the functional characteristics of some genes, the extent to which protein isoforms globally contribute to functional complexity on a proteomic scale remains unknown. To address this systematically, we cloned full-length open reading frames of alternatively spliced transcripts for a large number of human genes and used protein-protein interaction profiling to functionally compare hundreds of protein isoform pairs. The majority of isoform pairs share less than 50\% of their interactions. In the global context of interactome network maps, alternative isoforms tend to behave like distinct proteins rather than minor variants of each other. Interaction partners specific to alternative isoforms tend to be expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner and belong to distinct functional modules. Our strategy, applicable to other functional characteristics, reveals a widespread expansion of protein interaction capabilities through alternative splicing and suggests that many alternative “isoforms” are functionally divergent (i.e., “functional alloforms”).},

This should affect hubs.The network information is in Table S2B.This is from the text: "First we performed yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens in which all protein isoforms, fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (DB),were tested against proteins encoded by the hORFeome v5.1 collection of ∼15,000 ORF clones fused to the Gal4 activation domain(AD) (Dreze et al., 2010, Rolland et al., 2014 and Rual et al., 2005). Following first-pass screening, each protein isoform waspairwise tested for interaction with the candidate partners identified not only for itself but also for all first-pass partners of all other protein isoforms encoded by the same gene, thus minimizing biases due to incomplete sampling sensitivity (Venkatesan et al., 2009). To generate a final dataset of verified Y2H pairs, pairs showing a positive result in at least two out of the three pairwise tests were subjected to a fourth pairwise retest, and PCR products amplified from the final positive pairs were sequenced to confirm the identity of clones encoding each interacting protein (Figure 2A and Table S2B). Western blots were performed for all protein isoforms of a subset of randomly picked genes, demonstrating comparable heterologous protein expression of all isoforms of the same gene tested by Y2H (Figures 2B and S2A–S2H). Finally, to validate the overall quality of the PPI dataset of human protein pairs identified by Y2H, we selected a representative sample of the isoform-partner interacting and non-interacting pairs and subjected them to orthogonal validation in human HEK293T cells using a protein complementation assay (PCA) (Dreze et al., 2010 and Rolland et al., 2014) (Figure 2C; Table S2C). The isoform-partner positive pairs were recovered at a rate similar to that seen for pairs from a well-described positive reference set (PRS) (Venkatesan et al., 2009), while isoform-partner negative pairs validated at a rate similar to that seen for pairs from a random reference set (RRS) (Figure 2C and Tables S2C and S2D)."},

	abstract = {A new approach to understanding evolution [Val09], namely viewing it through the lens of computation, has already started yielding new insights, e.g., natural selection under sexual reproduction can be interpreted as the Multiplicative Weight Update (MWU) Algorithm in coordination games played among genes [CLPV14]. Using this machinery, we study the role of mutation in changing environments in the presence of sexual reproduction. Following [WVA05], we model changing environments via a Markov chain, with the states representing environments, each with its own fitness matrix. In this setting, we show that in the absence of mutation, the population goes extinct, but in the presence of mutation, the population survives with positive probability. On the way to proving the above theorem, we need to establish some facts about dynamics in games. We provide the first, to our knowledge, polynomial convergence bound for noisy MWU in a coordination game. Finally, we also show that in static environments, sexual evolution with mutation converges, for any level of mutation.},

	abstract = {How does new genetic information arise? Traditional thinking holds that mutation happens by accident and then spreads in the population by either natural selection or random genetic drift. There have been at least two fundamental conceptual problems with imagining an alternative. First, it seemed that the only alternative is a mutation that responds “smartly” to the immediate environment; but in complex multicellulars, it is hard to imagine how this could be implemented. Second, if there were mechanisms of mutation that “knew” what genetic changes would be favored in a given environment, this would have only begged the question of how they acquired that particular knowledge to begin with. This paper offers an alternative that avoids these problems. It holds that mutational mechanisms act on information that is in the genome, based on considerations of simplicity, parsimony, elegance, etc. (which are different than fitness considerations). This simplification process, under the performance pressure exerted by selection, not only leads to the improvement of adaptations but also creates elements that have the capacity to serve in new contexts they were not originally selected for. Novelty, then, arises at the system level from emergent interactions between such elements. Thus, mechanistically driven mutation neither requires Lamarckian transmission nor closes the door on novelty, because the changes it implements interact with one another globally in surprising and beneficial ways. Finally, I argue, for example, that genes used together are fused together; that simplification leads to complexity; and that evolution and learning are conceptually linked.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon, (popularly known as six degrees of separation). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

	abstract = {Presents statistical analyses of the search-space landscape of knapsack problems in due consideration of stochastic optimization. It is known from existing works that travelling salesman problems have a rugged landscape. We deal with 1000 knapsack problems where the values and the weights of the objects are arranged randomly. By introducing proper estimate values and topology, it is revealed that the landscape of these knapsack problems is a rugged landscape similar to that of the travelling salesman problems. It is assumed that the rugged landscape is a combination of a global valley-like structure and a local noise-like structure. We propose a new algorithm to estimate the optimum point by introducing the least mean square method to fit the global structure at some points selected randomly in the search space. The method does not contradict “no free lunch” theorems because of the availing features of the landscape. It is forecast that not only knapsack problems but also many practical problems have a structure which is characterized with the same measure. These results are useful in order to compose more effective optimization methods without a trial-and-error process},

	shorttitle = {No simple dependence between protein evolution rate and the number of protein-protein interactions},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that rates of protein evolution are influenced, to a great extent, by the proportion of amino acid residues that are directly involved in protein function. In agreement with this hypothesis, recent work has shown a negative correlation between evolutionary rates and the number of protein-protein interactions. However, the extent to which the number of protein-protein interactions influences evolutionary rates remains unclear. Here, we address this question at several different levels of evolutionary relatedness. RESULTS: Manually curated data on the number of protein-protein interactions among Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins was examined for possible correlation with evolutionary rates between S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe orthologs. Only a very weak negative correlation between the number of interactions and evolutionary rate of a protein was observed. Furthermore, no relationship was found between a more general measure of the evolutionary conservation of S. cerevisiae proteins, based on the taxonomic distribution of their homologs, and the number of protein-protein interactions. However, when the proteins from yeast were assorted into discrete bins according to the number of interactions, it turned out that 6.5\% of the proteins with the greatest number of interactions evolved, on average, significantly slower than the rest of the proteins. Comparisons were also performed using protein-protein interaction data obtained with high-throughput analysis of Helicobacter pylori proteins. No convincing relationship between the number of protein-protein interactions and evolutionary rates was detected, either for comparisons of orthologs from two completely sequenced H. pylori strains or for comparisons of H. pylori and Campylobacter jejuni orthologs, even when the proteins were classified into bins by the number of interactions. CONCLUSION: The currently available comparative-genomic data do not support the hypothesis that the evolutionary rates of the majority of proteins substantially depend on the number of protein-protein interactions they are involved in. However, a small fraction of yeast proteins with the largest number of interactions (the hubs of the interaction network) tend to evolve slower than the bulk of the proteins.},

Hence, the fact that it may break down highly favorable genetic combinations has been seen as a problem. Here, we consider an alternative approach. We define a measure that represents the ability of alleles to perform well across different combinations and, using numerical iterations within a classical population-genetic framework, show that selection in the presence of sex favors this ability in a highly robust manner. We also show that the mechanism responsible for this effect has been out of the purview of previous theory, because it operates during the evolutionary transient, and that the breaking down of favorable genetic combinations is an integral part of it. Implications of these results and more to evolutionary theory are discussed.},

We show that the number of interneuronal connections of the Euclidean length d decays exponentially with d, implying that the wiring cost, defined as the sum of the interneuronal distances, plays an important role in the actual neuronal network. Using the two methods to shuffle the neuronal network in systematic ways, the edge exchange and the vertex swapping, we show that positions of neurons are not randomly distributed but organized to reduce the wiring cost. Furthermore, we discuss the trade-off between the wiring cost and the performance of the network.},

	abstract = {Author Summary The number of personal genomes sequenced has grown rapidly over the last few years and is likely to grow further. In order to use the DNA sequence variants amongst individuals for personalized medicine, we need to understand the functional impact of these variants. Deleterious variants in genes can have a wide spectrum of global effects, ranging from fatal for essential genes to no obvious damaging effect for loss-of-function tolerant genes. The global effect of a gene mutation is largely governed by the diverse biological networks in which the gene participates. Since genes participate in many networks, no singular network captures the global picture of gene interactions. Here we integrate the diverse modes of gene interactions (regulatory, genetic, phosphorylation, signaling, metabolic and physical protein-protein interactions) to create a unified biological network. We then exploit the unique properties of loss-of-function tolerant and essential genes in this unified network to build a computational model that can predict global perturbation caused by deleterious mutations in all genes. Our model can distinguish between these two gene sets with high accuracy and we further show that it can be used for interpretation of variants involved in Mendelian diseases and in complex disorders probed by genome-wide association studies.},

The conventional view is that there are no new fundamental laws and principles in biology that aren’t derivable from chemistry and in turn physics."   "I will argue, perhaps only tentatively here, that quite the opposite is true, and that biology is full of new laws and principles that seem completely independent of physics. The TM, UTM, and (un)decidability exemplify the existence of universal laws and architectures that appear largely independent of physics." "The other extreme is statistical physics and its application to complex systems (SPCS), where the gaps are assumed to be so small that they can be covered by largely random ensembles and minimal tuning, as exemplified by such concepts and theories as “order for free, edge of chaos, self-organized criticality (SOC), scale-free networks” etc etc." "So the thing that appears easiest to measure, low level neural connectivity, or high level fMRI correlations, are almost certainly the least informative about what is most essential to how brain makes mind" "Instead it is the layering itself and the protocols that are universal and thus constrained that are the essence of architecture." "The dominance of mainstream “complexity” thinking by SPCS “order for free, edge of chaos, self-organized criticality (SOC), scale-free networks” despite how utterly wrong it has been continues to need addressing and again maybe Turing can help."}

Prior research into network theory and its application to software systems has found evidence that many important properties in real software systems exhibit approximately scale-free structure, including coupling; researchers have claimed that such scale-free structures are ubiquitous. This implies that high coupling must be unavoidable, statistically speaking, apparently contradicting standard ideas about software structure. We present a model that leads to the simple predictions that approximately scale-free structures ought to arise both for between-module connectivity and overall connectivity, and not as the result of poor design or optimization shortcuts. These predictions are borne out by our large-scale empirical study. Hence we conclude that high coupling is not avoidable—and that this is in fact quite reasonable.},

The formalism covers a broad range of steady-state dynamical processes and offers testable predictions regarding the system’s response to perturbations and the development of correlations. It predicts several distinct universality classes whose characteristics can be derived directly from the continuum equation governing the system’s dynamics and which are validated on several canonical network-based dynamical systems, from biochemical dynamics to epidemic spreading. Finally, we collect experimental data pertaining to social and biological systems, demonstrating that we can accurately uncover their universality class even in the absence of an appropriate continuum theory that governs the system’s dynamics.},

Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list—reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the “tumor microenvironment.” Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

How the organization of this network affects the evolution of the proteins that compose it is a fundamental question in molecular evolution. We show that the connectivity of well-conserved proteins in the network is negatively correlated with their rate of evolution. Proteins with more interactors evolve more slowly not because they are more important to the organism, but because a greater proportion of the protein is directly involved in its function. At sites important for interaction between proteins, evolutionary changes may occur largely by coevolution, in which substitutions in one protein result in selection pressure for reciprocal changes in interacting partners. We confirm one predicted outcome of this process—namely, that interacting proteins evolve at similar rates.},

	abstract = {The c-Myc oncogenic transcription factor (Myc) is pathologically activated in many human malignancies. Myc is known to directly upregulate a pro-tumorigenic group of microRNAs (miRNAs) known as the miR-17–92 cluster. Through the analysis of human and mouse models of B cell lymphoma, we show here that Myc regulates a much broader set of miRNAs than previously anticipated. Unexpectedly, the predominant consequence of activation of Myc is widespread repression of miRNA expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals that much of this repression is likely to be a direct result of Myc binding to miRNA promoters. We further show that enforced expression of repressed miRNAs diminishes the tumorigenic potential of lymphoma cells. These results demonstrate that extensive reprogramming of the miRNA transcriptome by Myc contributes to tumorigenesis.},

	abstract = {We present an approach to network formation based on the notion that social networks are formed by individual decisions that trade off the costs of forming and maintaining links against the potential rewards from doing so. We suppose that a link with another agent allows access, in part and in due course, to the benefits available to the latter via his own links. Thus individual links generate externalities whose value depends on the level of decay/delay associated with indirect links. A distinctive aspect of our approach is that the costs of link formation are incurred only by the person who initiates the link. This allows us to formulate the network formation process as a noncooperative game. We first provide a characterization of the architecture of equilibrium networks. We then study the dynamics of network formation. We find that individual efforts to access benefits offered by others lead, rapidly, to the emergence of an equilibrium social network, under a variety of circumstances. The limiting networks have simple architectures, e.g., the wheel, the star, or generalizations of these networks. In many cases, such networks are also socially efficient.},

We present a collection of empirical observations from social, biological, physical, and technological networks, for which such degree distributions give excellent fits.

A method whereby a nucleic acid sequence can be exponentially amplified in vitro is described in the chapter. The same method can be used to alter the amplified sequence or to append new sequence information to it. It is necessary that the ends of the sequence be known in sufficient detail that oligonucleotides can be synthesized, which will hybridize to them and that a small amount of the sequence be available to initiate the reaction. The oligonucleotides are complementary to different strands of the desired sequence and at relative positions along the sequence such that the DNA polymerase extension product of the one, when denatured, can serve as a template for the other and vice versa. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using an automated DNA synthesis machine (Biosearch, Inc., San Rafael, California) using phosphoramidite chemistry. “Mispriming"” can be usefully employed to make intentional in vitro mutations or to add sequence information to one or both ends of a given sequence. The chapter explores the possibility of utilizing a heat-stable DNA polymerase so as to avoid the need for addition of new enzyme after each cycle of thermal denaturation},

Here we consider generative models for the probability of a functional connection (an edge) between two cortical regions (nodes) separated by some Euclidean distance in anatomical space.

Furthermore, slightly detuned model parameters also generated a reasonable simulation of the abnormal properties of brain functional networks in people with schizophrenia.

	abstract = {Protein-folded DNA nanostructures A wide variety of DNA nanostructures have been assembled by folding long DNA single strands with short DNA staples. However, such structures typically need annealing at elevated temperatures in order to form. To accommodate the formation of such structures in living cells, Praetorius and Dietz developed an approach in which custom protein staples based on transcription activator–like effector proteins fold double-stranded DNA templates (see the Perspective by Douglas). The structures folded into user-defined geometric shapes on the scale of tens to hundreds of nanometers. These nanostructures could self-assemble at room temperature in physiological buffers. Science, this issue p. eaam5488; see also p. 1261 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONControlling the spatial arrangement of functional components in biological systems on the scale of higher-order macromolecular assemblies is an important goal in synthetic biology. Achieving this goal could yield new research tools and pave the way for interesting applications in health and biotechnology. DNA origami enables constructing arbitrary shapes on the desired scale by folding a single-stranded DNA “scaffold” into user-defined shapes using a set of “staple” oligonucleotides, but single-stranded DNA is typically not available in living cells, and the structures usually assemble only at nonphysiological temperatures. The scope of functions that can be fulfilled by DNA itself appears so far still limited. Proteins, on the other hand, offer a large variety of functionalities and are easily accessible in cells through genetic encoding, but designing larger structural frameworks from proteins alone remains challenging. RATIONALEHere, we reimagined DNA origami to explore the possibility for using a set of designed proteins to fold a double-stranded DNA template into user-defined DNA-protein hybrid objects with dimensions on the desired 10- to 100-nm scale. To realize our idea, we require synthetic DNA “looping” proteins that can link two user-defined double-helical DNA sequences, and we need to determine suitable rules for arranging both the template and multiple of such staple proteins in the context of a larger target structure. Transcription activator–like (TAL) effector proteins are produced by plant pathogenic bacteria and injected into host cells, where they bind to specific promoter regions, thus controlling the expression of target genes. The DNA recognizing part of a TAL effector consists of an array of repeat subunits that binds to the major groove of double-helical DNA, thus forming a superhelix. Each repeat subunit comprises {\textasciitilde}34 amino acids and recognizes a single DNA base pair. Because of their modular architecture, TAL effectors can be engineered to bind to user-defined DNA sequences, and this technique is currently being exploited for genome engineering applications. For constructing the staple proteins, we therefore chose the DNA-recognizing domains of TAL effectors. RESULTSWe characterized the DNA-recognizing domains of the TAL effectors with respect to binding affinity and sequence specificity. To construct the staple proteins, we fused two TAL proteins via a custom peptide linker and tested for the ability to connect two separate double-helical DNA domains. For creating larger objects containing multiple staple protein connections, we identified a set of rules regarding the optimal spacing between these connections. On the basis of these rules, we could create megadalton-scale objects that realize a variety of structural motifs, such as custom curvatures, vertices, and corners. Each of those objects was built from a set of 12 double-TAL staple proteins and a template DNA double strand with designed sequence. We also tested design principles for multilayer structures with enhanced rigidity. All components of our nanostructures can be genetically encoded and self-assemble isothermally at room temperature in near-physiological buffer conditions. The staple proteins used in this work also carried a green fluorescent protein domain that serves as a placeholder for a variety of functional protein domains that can be genetically fused to the staple proteins. We were also able to demonstrate formation of our structures starting from genetic expression in a one-pot reaction mixture that contained the double-stranded DNA scaffold, the genes encoding the staple proteins, RNA polymerase, ribosomes, and cofactors for transcription and translation. Successful self-assembly of our hybrid nanostructures was confirmed using transmission electron microscopy. CONCLUSIONBy using our system of designing double-TAL staple proteins that fold a template DNA double strand, researchers can control the spatial arrangement of protein domains in custom geometries. Our system should have a good chance to work inside cells, given the success of our in vitro expression experiments and considering that the DNA binding properties of TAL are preserved inside cells, as seen in gene editing experiments with TAL-based endonucleases. Because TAL-based staple proteins can be tailored to specifically recognize any desired DNA target sequence, these proteins could then be used to create custom structures and loops in genomic DNA to study the relation between genome architecture and gene expression, or to position proteins involved in other intracellular processes in user-defined ways. textlessimg class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/355/6331/eaam5488/F1.medium.gif"/textgreater Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Schematic illustration of the self-assembly of DNA-protein hybrid objects from a set of 12 double-TAL staple proteins and a template DNA double strand.Depending on the sequence of the template, the resulting object may be a square (top) or a double-ring circle (bottom). In total, we designed 18 different protein hybrid objects using this principle. Scale bar, 20 nm. We describe an approach to bottom-up fabrication that allows integration of the functional diversity of proteins into designed three-dimensional structural frameworks. A set of custom staple proteins based on transcription activator–like effector proteins folds a double-stranded DNA template into a user-defined shape. Each staple protein is designed to recognize and closely link two distinct double-helical DNA sequences at separate positions on the template. We present design rules for constructing megadalton-scale DNA-protein hybrid shapes; introduce various structural motifs, such as custom curvature, corners, and vertices; and describe principles for creating multilayer DNA-protein objects with enhanced rigidity. We demonstrate self-assembly of our hybrid nanostructures in one-pot mixtures that include the genetic information for the designed proteins, the template DNA, RNA polymerase, ribosomes, and cofactors for transcription and translation. Folding DNA double strands using custom staple proteins can form megadalton-scale nanostructures with user-defined shapes.

	abstract = {The relationship between the topology of a biological network and its functional or evolutionary properties has attracted much recent interest. It has been suggested that most, if not all, biological networks are ‘scale free.’ That is, their connections follow power-law distributions, such that there are very few nodes with very many connections and vice versa. The number of target genes of known transcriptional regulators in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, appears to follow such a distribution, as do other networks, such as the yeast network of protein–protein interactions. These findings have inspired attempts to draw biological inferences from general properties associated with scale-free network topology. One often cited general property is that, when compromised, highly connected nodes will tend to have a larger effect on network function than sparsely connected nodes. For example, more highly connected proteins are more likely to be lethal when knocked out. However, the correlation between lethality and connectivity is relatively weak, and some highly connected proteins can be removed without noticeable phenotypic effect. Similarly, network topology only weakly predicts the response of gene expression to environmental perturbations. Evolutionary simulations of gene-regulatory networks, presented here, suggest that such weak or non-existent correlations are to be expected, and are likely not due to inadequacy of experimental data. We argue that ‘top-down’ inferences of biological properties based on simple measures of network topology are of limited utility, and we present simulation results suggesting that much more detailed information about a gene’s location in a regulatory network, as well as dynamic gene-expression data, are needed to make more meaningful functional and evolutionary predictions. Specifically, we find in our simulations that: (1) the relationship between a gene’s connectivity and its fitness effect upon knockout depends on its equilibrium expression level; (2) correlation between connectivity and genetic variation is virtually non-existent, yet upon independent evolution of networks with identical topologies, some nodes exhibit consistently low or high polymorphism; and (3) certain genes show low polymorphism yet high divergence among independent evolutionary runs. This latter pattern is generally taken as a signature of positive selection, but in our simulations its cause is often neutral coevolution of regulatory inputs to the same gene.},

Many cellular networks are claimed to have a “scale-free” organization with few central hubs and many nodes bearing few links (Barabási and Oltvai, 2004). Such structures were suggested to resist random perturbations because of a low probability that a perturbation affects the sensitive hubs Albert et al. 2000; Jeong et al. 2000 ;  Ravasz et al. 2002. However, it is unclear to what extent these high-level abstractions are able to capture network functionality because experimental observations barely support key predictions of the theory (Hahn et al., 2004). If, for instance, crosstalk was vital for coordination of cellular functions, the pure topological argument implying equal importance of all interactions would not hold. Moreover, robustness of modules is distinct from robustness of collections of modules such as pathways or cells. Thus, we will have to account for the interplay between different cellular networks, their potential dynamics, and foremost, a rigorous comparison with experimental observations.   However, it is unclear to what extent these high-level abstractions are able to capture network functionality because experimental observations barely support key predictions of the theory}

	abstract = {The classical view of computing positions computation as a closed-box transformation of inputs (rational numbers or finite strings) to outputs. According to the interactive view of computing, computation is an ongoing interactive process rather than a function-based transformation of an input to an output. Specifically, communication with the outside world happens during the computation, not before or after it. This approach radically changes our understanding of what is computation and how it is modeled. The acceptance of interaction as a new paradigm is hindered by the Strong Church–Turing Thesis (SCT), the widespread belief that Turing Machines (TMs) capture all computation, so models of computation more expressive than TMs are impossible. In this paper, we show that SCT reinterprets the original Church–Turing Thesis (CTT) in a way that Turing never intended; its commonly assumed equivalence to the original is a myth. We identify and analyze the historical reasons for the widespread belief in SCT. Only by accepting that it is false can we begin to adopt interaction as an alternative paradigm of computation. We present Persistent Turing Machines (PTMs), that extend TMs to capture sequential interaction. PTMs allow us to formulate the Sequential Interaction Thesis, going beyond the expressiveness of TMs and of the CTT. The paradigm shift to interaction provides an alternative understanding of the nature of computing that better reflects the services provided by today’s computing technology.},

	abstract = {An important step in genetic recombination is DNA branch migration, the movement of the Holliday junction or exchange point between two homologous duplex DNAs. We have determined kinetic parameters of spontaneous branch migration as a function of temperature and ionic conditions. The branch migration substrates consist of two homologous duplex DNAs each having two single-strand tails at one end that are complementary to the corresponding single-strand tails of the other duplex. Upon rapid annealing of the two duplex DNAs, a four-stranded intermediate is formed that has a Holliday junction at one end of the duplexes. Branch migration to the opposite end of the duplexes results in complete strand exchange and formation of two duplex products. The rate of branch migration is exceedingly sensitive to the type of metal ions present. In magnesium, branch migration is quite slow with a step time, tau, equal to 300 msec at 37 degrees C. Surprisingly, branch migration in the absence of magnesium was 1000 times faster. Despite this difference in rates, apparent activation energies for the branch migration step in the presence and absence of magnesium are similar. Since metal ions have a profound effect on the structure of the Holliday junction, it appears that the structure of the branch point plays a key role in determining the rate of spontaneous DNA branch migration. We discuss the role of proteins in promoting the branch migration step during homologous recombination.},

Solutions to the abductive inference problem define signed-directed networks that explain how genes are affected during the experiments. Using in-silico datasets provided by the dialogue for reverse engineering assessments and methods (DREAM) consortium, the chapter demonstrates the improved predictive power and complexity of the inferred network topologies compared with those generated by other non-symbolic inference approaches.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been shown for an evolutionarily distant genomic comparison that the number of protein-protein interactions a protein has correlates negatively with their rates of evolution. However, the generality of this observation has recently been challenged. Here we examine the problem using protein-protein interaction data from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and genome sequences from two other yeast species. RESULTS: In contrast to a previous study that used an incomplete set of protein-protein interactions, we observed a highly significant correlation between number of interactions and evolutionary distance to either Candida albicans or Schizosaccharomyces pombe. This study differs from the previous one in that it includes all known protein interactions from S. cerevisiae, and a larger set of protein evolutionary rates. In both evolutionary comparisons, a simple monotonic relationship was found across the entire range of the number of protein-protein interactions. In agreement with our earlier findings, this relationship cannot be explained by the fact that proteins with many interactions tend to be important to yeast. The generality of these correlations in other kingdoms of life unfortunately cannot be addressed at this time, due to the incompleteness of protein-protein interaction data from organisms other than S. cerevisiae. CONCLUSIONS: Protein-protein interactions tend to slow the rate at which proteins evolve. This may be due to structural constraints that must be met to maintain interactions, but more work is needed to definitively establish the mechanism(s) behind the correlations we have observed.},

In a different intellectual domain, learning theory links incremental adaptation (e.g., from positive and/or negative reinforcement) to intelligent behaviour. Specifically, learning theory explains how incremental adaptation can acquire knowledge from past experience and use it to direct future behaviours toward favourable outcomes. Until recently such cognitive learning seemed irrelevant to the ‘uninformed’ process of evolution. In our opinion, however, new results formally linking evolutionary processes to the principles of learning might provide solutions to several evolutionary puzzles – the evolution of evolvability, the evolution of ecological organisation, and evolutionary transitions in individuality. If so, the ability for evolution to learn might explain how it produces such apparently intelligent designs.},

A global organization of plant biological processes emerges from community analyses of the resulting network, together with large numbers of novel hypothetical functional links between proteins and pathways. We observe a dynamic rewiring of interactions following gene duplication events, providing evidence for a model of evolution acting upon interactome networks. This and future plant interactome maps should facilitate systems approaches to better understand plant biology and improve crops.

Biological systems are extraordinarily robust to perturbation by mutations, recombination and the environment. It has been proposed that this robustness might make them more evolvable. Robustness to mutation allows genetic variation to accumulate in a cryptic state. Switching mechanisms known as evolutionary capacitors mean that the amount of heritable phenotypic variation available can be correlated to the degree of stress and hence to the novelty of the environment and remaining potential for adaptation. There have been two somewhat separate literatures relating robustness to evolvability. One has focused on molecular phenotypes and new mutations, the other on morphology and cryptic genetic variation. Here, we review both literatures, and show that the true distinction is whether recombination rates are high or low. In both cases, the evidence supports the claim that robustness promotes evolvability.},

	abstract = {Author Summary Many biological systems show bow-tie (also called hourglass) architecture. A bow-tie means that a large number of inputs are converted to a small number of intermediates, which then fan out to generate a large number of outputs. For example, cells use a wide variety of nutrients; process them into 12 metabolic precursors, which are then used to make all of the cells biomass. Similar principles exist in biological signaling and in the information processing in the visual system. Despite the ubiquity of bow-tie structures in biology, there is no explanation of how they evolved. Here, we find that bow-ties spontaneously evolve when the information in the evolutionary goal they evolved to satisfy can be compressed. Mathematically, this means that the matrix representing the goal has deficient rank. The maximal compression possible determines the width of the bow-tie—the narrowest part in the network (equal to the rank of the goal matrix). This offers a mechanism to understand a common architectural principle of biological systems, and a way to quantitate the rank of the goals under which they evolved.},

Here we present a systematic comparative mathematical analysis of the metabolic networks of 43 organisms representing all three domains of life. We show that, despite significant variation in their individual constituents and pathways, these metabolic networks have the same topological scaling properties and show striking similarities to the inherent organization of complex non-biological systems. This may indicate that metabolic organization is not only identical for all living organisms, but also complies with the design principles of robust and error-tolerant scale-free networks, and may represent a common blueprint for the large-scale organization of interactions among all cellular constituents.},

Its practical applications are found in all areas in which complex networks need to be modeled – a large number of random graph models are thus known, mirroring the diverse types of complex networks encountered in different areas.

In this review, we distinguish between two types of biological models—mathematical and computational—which differ in their representations of biological phenomena. We call the approach of constructing computational models of biological systems 'executable biology', as it focuses on the design of executable computer algorithms that mimic biological phenomena. We survey the main modeling efforts in this direction, emphasize the applicability and benefits of executable models in biological research and highlight some of the challenges that executable biology poses for biology and computer science. We claim that for executable biology to reach its full potential as a mainstream biological technique, formal and algorithmic approaches must be integrated into biological research. This will drive biology toward a more precise engineering discipline.},

	abstract = {According to the interactive view of computation, communication happens during the computation, not before or after it. This approach, distinct from concurrency theory and the theory of computation, represents a paradigm shift that changes our understanding of what is computation and how it is modeled. Interaction machines extend Turing machines with interaction to capture the behavior of concurrent systems, promising to bridge these two fields. This promise is hindered by the widespread belief, incorrectly known as the Church-Turing thesis, that no model of computation more expressive than Turing machines can exist. Yet Turing’s original thesis only refers to the computation of functions and explicitly excludes other computational paradigms such as interaction. In this paper, we identify and analyze the historical reasons for this widespread belief. Only by accepting that it is false can we begin to properly investigate formal models of interaction machines. We conclude the paper by presenting one such model, Persistent Turing Machines (PTMs). PTMs capture sequential interaction, which is a limited form of concurrency; they allow us to formulate the Sequential Interaction Thesis, going beyond the expressiveness of Turing machines and of the Church-Turing thesis.},

Of particular interest is the phenomenon of multivalency, which is characterized by simultaneous binding of multiple ligands on one biological entity to multiple receptors on another. Various approaches have been developed to engineer multivalency by linking multiple ligands together. However, the effects of well-controlled inter-ligand distances on multivalency are less well understood. Recent progress in self-assembling DNA nanostructures with spatial and sequence addressability has made deterministic positioning of different molecular species possible. Here we show that distance-dependent multivalent binding effects can be systematically investigated by incorporating multiple-affinity ligands into DNA nanostructures with precise nanometre spatial control. Using atomic force microscopy, we demonstrate direct visualization of high-affinity bivalent ligands being used as pincers to capture and display protein molecules on a nanoarray. These results illustrate the potential of using designer DNA nanoscaffolds to engineer more complex and interactive biomolecular networks.},

Here, I present two lessons that I derived from my own quest: the importance of studying biological information processing to identify common principles in seemingly unrelated contexts and the adequacy of using known design principles at one level of biological organization as a valuable tool to help recognizing principles at an alternative one.

Currents ranging from tens of picoamperes to more than 100 pA were measured in the G4-DNA over distances ranging from tens of nanometres to more than 100 nm. Our experimental results, combined with theoretical modelling, suggest that transport occurs via a thermally activated long-range hopping between multi-tetrad segments of DNA.

Although phenotypic variance is a central measure in the mapping of the genotype and environment to the phenotype in quantitative evolutionary genetics, robustness is also a key feature in systems biology, resulting from nonlinearities in quantitative relationships between upstream and downstream components. In this Review, we provide a synthesis of these two lines of investigation, converging on understanding how variation propagates across biological systems. We critically assess the recent proliferation of studies identifying robustness-conferring genes in the context of the nonlinearity in biological systems. View full text},

	abstract = {This paper considers Web layout design in the spirit of source coding for data compression and rate distortion theory, with the aim of minimizing the average size of files downloaded during Web browsing sessions. The novel aspect here is that the object of design is layout rather than codeword selection, and is subject to navigability constraints. This produces statistics for file transfers that are heavy tailed, completely unlike standard Shannon theory, and provides a natural and plausible explanation for the origin of observed power laws in Web traffic. We introduce a series of theoretical and simulation models for optimal Web layout design with varying levels of analytic tractability and realism with respect to modeling of structure, hyperlinks, and user behavior. All models produce power laws which are striking both for their consistency with each other and with observed data, and their robustness to modeling assumptions. These results suggest that heavy tails are a permanent and ubiquitous feature of Internet traffic, and not an artifice of current applications or user behavior. They also suggest new ways of thinking about protocol design that combines insights from information and control theory with traditional networking},

	abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate performances of published gene signatures for the assessment of urothelial carcinoma. Experimental Design: We evaluated 28 published gene signatures designed for diagnostic and prognostic purposes of urothelial cancer. The investigated signatures include eight signatures for stage, five for grade, four for progression, and six for survival. We used two algorithms for classification, nearest centroid classification and support vector machine, and Cox regression to evaluate signature performance in four independent data sets. Results: The overlap of genes among the signatures was low, ranging from 11\% among stage signatures to 0.6\% among survival signatures. The published signatures predicted muscle-invasive and high-grade tumors with accuracies in the range of 70\% to 90\%. The performance for a given signature varied considerably with the validation data set used, and interestingly, some of the best performing signatures were not designed for the tested classification problem. In addition, several nonbladder-derived gene signatures performed equally well. Large randomly selected gene signatures performed better than the published signatures, and by systematically increasing signature size, we show that signatures with textgreater150 genes are needed to obtain robust performance in independent validation data sets. None of the published survival signatures performed better than random assignments when applied to independent validation data. Conclusion: We conclude that gene expression signatures with textgreater150 genes predict muscle-invasive growth and high-grade tumors with robust accuracies.

	abstract = {That regulatory evolution is important in generating phenotypic diversity was suggested soon after the discovery of gene regulation. In the past few decades, studies in animals have provided a number of examples in which phenotypic changes can be traced back to specific alterations in transcriptional regulation. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology and functional genomics have stimulated a new wave of investigation in simple model organisms. In particular, several genome-wide comparative analyses of transcriptional circuits across different yeast species have been performed. These studies have revealed that transcription networks are remarkably plastic: large scale rewiring in which target genes move in and out of regulons through changes in cis-regulatory sequences appears to be a general phenomenon. Transcription factor substitution and the formation of new combinatorial interactions are also important contributors to the rewiring. In several cases, a transition through intermediates with redundant regulatory programs has been suggested as a mechanism through which rewiring can occur without a loss in fitness. Because the basic features of transcriptional regulation are deeply conserved, we speculate that large scale rewiring may underlie the evolution of complex phenotypes in multi-cellular organisms; if so, such rewiring may leave traceable changes in the genome from which the genetic basis of functional innovation can be detected.},

Studies with computational models, however, have suggested that denser gene networks evolve to be more dynamically robust than sparser networks. We resolve this discrepancy by showing that misassumptions about how to measure robustness in artificial networks have inadvertently discounted the costs of network complexity. We show that when the costs of complexity are taken into account, that robustness implies a parsimonious network structure that is sparsely connected and not unnecessarily complex; and that selection will favor sparse networks when network topology is free to evolve. Because a robust system of heredity is necessary for the adaptive evolution of complex phenotypes, the maintenance of frugal network complexity is likely a crucial design constraint that underlies biological organization.},

It remains unclear, however, if the predictions of ‘universal’ scaling models for vascular plants hold across diverse species in variable environments. Phenomena such as competition and disturbance may drive allometric scaling relationships away from theoretical predictions based on an optimized tree. Here, we use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to calculate tree-specific, species-specific, and ‘global’ (i.e. interspecific) scaling exponents for several allometric relationships using tree- and branch-level data harvested from three savanna sites across a rainfall gradient in Mali, West Africa. We use these exponents to provide a rigorous test of three plant scaling models (Metabolic Scaling Theory (MST), Geometric Similarity, and Stress Similarity) in savanna systems. For the allometric relationships we evaluated (diameter vs. length, aboveground mass, stem mass, and leaf mass) the empirically calculated exponents broadly overlapped among species from diverse environments, except for the scaling exponents for length, which increased with tree cover and density. When we compare empirical scaling exponents to the theoretical predictions from the three models we find MST predictions are most consistent with our observed allometries. In those situations where observations are inconsistent with MST we find that departure from theory corresponds with expected tradeoffs related to disturbance and competitive interactions. We hypothesize savanna trees have greater length-scaling exponents than predicted by MST due to an evolutionary tradeoff between fire escape and optimization of mechanical stability and internal resource transport. Future research on the drivers of systematic allometric variation could reconcile the differences between observed scaling relationships in variable ecosystems and those predicted by ideal models such as MST.},

Using the two methods to shuffle the neuronal network in systematic ways, the edge exchange and the vertex swapping, we show that positions of neurons are not randomly distributed but organized to reduce the wiring cost.

For example, relatively simple organisms grow, persist and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions, an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic network. Complex communication networks display a surprising degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. Here we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks, which include the World-Wide Web, the Internet, social networks and cells. We find that such networks display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected even by unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity). Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties of communication networks.},

	abstract = {In this review I show that the ‘3/4-power scaling law’ of metabolic rate is not universal, either within or among animal species. Significant variation in the scaling of metabolic rate with body mass is described mainly for animals, but also for unicells and plants. Much of this variation, which can be related to taxonomic, physiological, and/or environmental differences, is not adequately explained by existing theoretical models, which are also reviewed. As a result, synthetic explanatory schemes based on multiple boundary constraints and on the scaling of multiple energy-using processes are advocated. It is also stressed that a complete understanding of metabolic scaling will require the identification of both proximate (functional)and ultimate (evolutionary)causes. Four major types of intraspecific metabolic scaling with body mass are recognized [based on the power function R=aMb, where R is respiration (metabolic) rate, a is a constant, M is body mass, and b is the scaling exponent]: Type I: linear, negatively allometric (b textless1); Type II: linear, isometric (b=1); Type III: nonlinear, ontogenetic shift from isometric (b=1), or nearly isometric, to negatively allometric (b textless1); and Type IV: nonlinear, ontogenetic shift from positively allometric (b textgreater 1) to one or two later phases of negative allometry (b textless1). Ontogenetic changes in the metabolic intensity of four component processes (i.e.growth, reproduction, locomotion, and heat production) appear to be important in these different patterns of metabolic scaling. These changes may, in turn, be shaped by age (size)-specific patterns of mortality. In addition, major differences in interspecific metabolic scaling are described, especially with respect to mode of temperature regulation, body-size range, and activity level. A‘metabolic-level boundaries hypothesis’ focusing on two major constraints (surface-area limits on resource/waste exchange processes and mass/volume limits on power production) can explain much, but not all of this variation. My analysis indicates that further empirical and theoretical work is needed to understand fully the physiological and ecological bases for the considerable variation in metabolic scaling that is observed both within and among species.Recommended approaches for doing this are discussed. I conclude that the scaling of metabolism is not the simple result of a physical law, but rather appears to be the more complex result of diverse adaptations evolved in the context of both physico-chemical and ecological constraints.},

Large scale experimental studies – studying the performance of a variety of optimization algorithms across a large collection of diverse problem instances – provide the resources to derive these conditions. Data mining techniques can be used to learn the relationships between the critical features of the instances and the performance of algorithms. This paper discusses how we can adequately characterize the features of a problem instance that have impact on difficulty in terms of algorithmic performance, and how such features can be defined and measured for various optimization problems. We provide a comprehensive survey of the research field with a focus on six combinatorial optimization problems: assignment, traveling salesman, and knapsack problems, bin-packing, graph coloring, and timetabling. For these problems – which are important abstractions of many real-world problems – we review hardness-revealing features as developed over decades of research, and we discuss the suitability of more problem-independent landscape metrics. We discuss how the features developed for one problem may be transferred to study related problems exhibiting similar structures.},

	abstract = {A comparison of the evolutionary rates of cranial morphology in mammals with the neutral expectation suggests that stabilizing selection is a predominant evolutionary force keeping the long-term diversification of lineages well below its potential. The rate of morphological divergence of almost all lineages, including the great apes, is substantially below the minimum neutral expectation. The divergence of the modern races of man is slightly above the minimum neutral rate but well below the maximum rate. Therefore, there is no need to invoke extraordinary mutational mechanisms, such as regulatory gene evolution, to explain what has been perceived as rapid morphological evolution in mammals. Nor does it appear that behavioral drive needs to be invoked to explain rapid morphological evolution in hominoids. Outside of man, the long-term rate of phenotypic evolution in the great apes is actually lower than that for other mammals. The data suggest that, immediately after reproductive isolation, most lineages diverge morphologically at approximately the neutral rate and that this rate declines over evolutionary time. Such a pattern is consistent with a broad class of phenotypic evolutionary models that invoke an interaction between the forces of random genetic drift, polygenic mutation, and stabilizing selection. This pattern also suggests that the apparently rapid rates of morphological evolution in modern man relative to other mammals and in mammals relative to other vertebrates are artifacts of temporal scaling.},

For a nominal familywise error rate of 5\%, the parametric statistical methods are shown to be conservative for voxelwise inference and invalid for clusterwise inference. Our results suggest that the principal cause of the invalid cluster inferences is spatial autocorrelation functions that do not follow the assumed Gaussian shape. By comparison, the nonparametric permutation test is found to produce nominal results for voxelwise as well as clusterwise inference.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been shown for an evolutionarily distant genomic comparison that the number of protein-protein interactions a protein has correlates negatively with their rates of evolution. However, the generality of this observation has recently been challenged. Here we examine the problem using protein-protein interaction data from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and genome sequences from two other yeast species. RESULTS: In contrast to a previous study that used an incomplete set of protein-protein interactions, we observed a highly significant correlation between number of interactions and evolutionary distance to either Candida albicans or Schizosaccharomyces pombe. This study differs from the previous one in that it includes all known protein interactions from S. cerevisiae, and a larger set of protein evolutionary rates. In both evolutionary comparisons, a simple monotonic relationship was found across the entire range of the number of protein-protein interactions. In agreement with our earlier findings, this relationship cannot be explained by the fact that proteins with many interactions tend to be important to yeast. The generality of these correlations in other kingdoms of life unfortunately cannot be addressed at this time, due to the incompleteness of protein-protein interaction data from organisms other than S. cerevisiae. CONCLUSIONS: Protein-protein interactions tend to slow the rate at which proteins evolve. This may be due to structural constraints that must be met to maintain interactions, but more work is needed to definitively establish the mechanism(s) behind the correlations we have observed.},

	abstract = {In gene regulatory circuits, the expression of individual genes is commonly modulated by a set of regulating gene products, which bind to a gene’s cis-regulatory region. This region encodes an input-output function, referred to as signal-integration logic, that maps a specific combination of regulatory signals (inputs) to a particular expression state (output) of a gene. The space of all possible signal-integration functions is vast and the mapping from input to output is many-to-one: for the same set of inputs, many functions (genotypes) yield the same expression output (phenotype). Here, we exhaustively enumerate the set of signal-integration functions that yield idential gene expression patterns within a computational model of gene regulatory circuits. Our goal is to characterize the relationship between robustness and evolvability in the signal-integration space of regulatory circuits, and to understand how these properties vary between the genotypic and phenotypic scales. Among other results, we find that the distributions of genotypic robustness are skewed, such that the majority of signal-integration functions are robust to perturbation. We show that the connected set of genotypes that make up a given phenotype are constrained to specific regions of the space of all possible signal-integration functions, but that as the distance between genotypes increases, so does their capacity for unique innovations. In addition, we find that robust phenotypes are (i) evolvable, (ii) easily identified by random mutation, and (iii) mutationally biased toward other robust phenotypes. We explore the implications of these latter observations for mutation-based evolution by conducting random walks between randomly chosen source and target phenotypes. We demonstrate that the time required to identify the target phenotype is independent of the properties of the source phenotype.},

Biological systems are extraordinarily robust to perturbation by mutations, recombination and the environment. It has been proposed that this robustness might make them more evolvable. Robustness to mutation allows genetic variation to accumulate in a cryptic state. Switching mechanisms known as evolutionary capacitors mean that the amount of heritable phenotypic variation available can be correlated to the degree of stress and hence to the novelty of the environment and remaining potential for adaptation. There have been two somewhat separate literatures relating robustness to evolvability. One has focused on molecular phenotypes and new mutations, the other on morphology and cryptic genetic variation. Here, we review both literatures, and show that the true distinction is whether recombination rates are high or low. In both cases, the evidence supports the claim that robustness promotes evolvability.},

For example, system growth has traditionally been quantified using lines of code or number of functions, but functional growth of an operating system like Linux can also be quantified using the number of system calls. In addition we use the availability of the source code to track metrics, such as McCabe’s cyclomatic complexity, that have not been tracked across so many versions previously. We find that the data supports several of Lehman’s laws, mainly those concerned with growth and with the stability of the process. We also make some novel observations, e.g. that the average complexity of functions is decreasing with time, but this is mainly due to the addition of many small functions.},

The organic solvents dissolve lipids from cell membranes making them permeable to antibodies. Because the organic solvents also coagulate proteins, they can be used to fix and permeabilize cells at the same time. Saponin interacts with membrane cholesterol, selectively removing it and leaving holes in the membrane. The disadvantage of detergents such as Triton X-100 and Tween-20 is that they are non-selective in nature and may extract proteins along with the lipids.

Our focus is on systems which are optimized, either through natural selection or engineering design, to provide robust performance despite uncertain environments. We suggest that power laws in these systems are due to tradeoffs between yield, cost of resources, and tolerance to risks. These tradeoffs lead to highly optimized designs that allow for occasional large events. We investigate the mechanism in the context of percolation and sand pile models in order to emphasize the sharp contrasts between HOT and self-organized criticality (SOC), which has been widely suggested as the origin for power laws in complex systems. Like SOC, HOT produces power laws. However, compared to SOC, HOT states exist for densities which are higher than the critical density, and the power laws are not restricted to special values of the density. The characteristic features of HOT systems include: (1) high efficiency, performance, and robustness to designed-for uncertainties; (2) hypersensitivity to design flaws and unanticipated perturbations; (3) nongeneric, specialized, structured configurations; and (4) power laws. The first three of these are in contrast to the traditional hallmarks of criticality, and are obtained by simply adding the element of design to percolation and sand pile models, which completely changes their characteristics.},

	abstract = {Canalisation (or canalization) is a measure of the ability of a population to produce the same phenotype regardless of variability of its environment or genotype. In other words, it means robustness. The term canalisation was coined by C. H. Waddington, who used the word to capture the fact that "developmental reactions, as they occur in organisms submitted to natural selection...are adjusted so as to bring about one definite end-result regardless of minor variations in conditions during the course of the reaction". He used this word rather than robustness to take into account that biological systems are not robust in quite the same way as, for example, engineered systems. Biological robustness or canalisation comes about when developmental pathways are shaped by evolution. Waddington introduced the epigenetic landscape, in which the state of an organism rolls "downhill" during development. In this metaphor, a canalised trait is illustrated as a valley enclosed by high ridges, safely guiding the phenotype to its "fate". Waddington claimed that canals form in the epigenetic landscape during evolution, and that this heuristic is useful for understanding the unique qualities of biological robustness. textasciicircum Waddington CH (1942).

There is room for disagreement with what constitutes an appropriate null model for network evolution but, given that evolution is a population-level process, we start with the assumption that any such model must incorporate the fundamental principles of population genetics. Such an approach is a significant departure from most previous work in this area.   Although the models presented here are simplistic in many ways, ignoring, for example, the details of molecular kinetics and the likelihood that small networks will often be imbedded in a larger set of interactions, they are far more biologically realistic than previous attempts to model network evolution as a series of saltational (instantaneous and stepwise) events (for example, Refs 2,3,62–66). (see 'evolution' subcollection under 'Network Theory" collection)   such studies simulate the construction of network topologies by pre-specified rules for stochastic node attachment, gene duplication and/or transcription-factor binding site origin, with no attention being given to the intermediate states that necessarily exist in the context of actual populations. Relying on this approach, deviations of observed patterns of network connectivity from those that are generated with randomly assembled networks have often been invoked as evidence for the guiding hand of natural selection in the evolution of network architecture2, 3, 67, 68. while barabasi etc use duplication to explain pref. attach., lynch uses it as an alternative explanation for 'robustness' :Such observations raise significant questions about whether distributed robustness (the tendency for single-gene knockouts to have less-than-lethal effects as a consequence of excess network connections) evolves by natural selection21, 61, as opposed to being an unavoidable by-product of the purely physical processes of mutation and duplication.},

	abstract = {The principle that /`popularity is attractive/' underlies preferential attachment, which is a common explanation for the emergence of scaling in growing networks. If new connections are made preferentially to more popular nodes, then the resulting distribution of the number of connections possessed by nodes follows power laws, as observed in many real networks. Preferential attachment has been directly validated for some real networks (including the Internet), and can be a consequence of different underlying processes based on node fitness, ranking, optimization, random walks or duplication. Here we show that popularity is just one dimension of attractiveness; another dimension is similarity. We develop a framework in which new connections optimize certain trade-offs between popularity and similarity, instead of simply preferring popular nodes. The framework has a geometric interpretation in which popularity preference emerges from local optimization. As opposed to preferential attachment, our optimization framework accurately describes the large-scale evolution of technological (the Internet), social (trust relationships between people) and biological (Escherichia coli metabolic) networks, predicting the probability of new links with high precision. The framework that we have developed can thus be used for predicting new links in evolving networks, and provides a different perspective on preferential attachment as an emergent phenomenon.},

In [2] and, with Jeong, in [3], Barabási and Albert suggested that after many steps the proportion P(d) of vertices with degree d should obey a power law P(d)αd−γ. They obtained γ=2.9±0.1 by experiment and gave a simple heuristic argument suggesting that γ=3.

Suppressing population structures reduce the difference between two competing variants, while amplifying population structures enhance the difference. Suppressors are ubiquitous and easy to construct, but amplifiers for the large population limit are more elusive and only a few examples have been discovered. Whether or not a population structure is an amplifier of selection depends on the probability distribution for the placement of the invading mutant. First, we prove that there exist only bounded amplifiers for adversarial placement—that is, for arbitrary initial conditions. Next, we show that the Star population structure, which is known to amplify for mutants placed uniformly at random, does not amplify for mutants that arise through reproduction and are therefore placed proportional to the temperatures of the vertices. Finally, we construct population structures that amplify for all mutational events that arise through reproduction, uniformly at random, or through some combination of the two.},

	abstract = {There are deep, yet largely unexplored, connections between computer science and biology. Both disciplines examine how information proliferates in time and space. Central results in computer science describe the complexity of algorithms that solve certain classes of problems. An algorithm is deemed efficient if it can solve a problem in polynomial time, which means the running time of the algorithm is a polynomial function of the length of the input. There are classes of harder problems for which the fastest possible algorithm requires exponential time. Another criterion is the space requirement of the algorithm. There is a crucial distinction between algorithms that can find a solution, verify a solution, or list several distinct solutions in given time and space. The complexity hierarchy that is generated in this way is the foundation of theoretical computer science. Precise complexity results can be notoriously difficult. The famous question whether polynomial time equals nondeterministic polynomial time (i.e., P = NP) is one of the hardest open problems in computer science and all of mathematics. Here, we consider simple processes of ecological and evolutionary spatial dynamics. The basic question is: What is the probability that a new invader (or a new mutant) will take over a resident population? We derive precise complexity results for a variety of scenarios. We therefore show that some fundamental questions in this area cannot be answered by simple equations (assuming that P is not equal to NP).},

When the information refers to a particular node at which both quantities are measured, the model can be taken as a model for gossip propagation. In this context, we apply the model to real empirical networks of social acquaintances and compare the underlying spreading dynamics with different types of scale-free and small-world networks. We find that the number of friendship connections strongly influences the probability of being gossiped. Finally, we discuss how the spread factor is able to be applied to other situations.},

	abstract = {Lens of Computation on the Sciences - November 22, 2014 The Computational Universe - Leslie Valiant, Harvard University The idea that computation has its own laws and limitations emerged in the 1930s. Some of the early computing pioneers, most notably Turing and von Neumann, already understood that this idea had far reaching implications beyond technology. It offered a new way of looking at the world, in terms of computational processes. Turing and von Neumann themselves pursued this perspective in such areas as genetics, biological development, cognition, and the brain. There has been much progress in the intervening years in understanding computation. The question that arises for our generation is how to exploit this increasing knowledge to obtain insights into the natural world that cannot be obtained otherwise. Valiant will focus on biological evolution approached from this standpoint. The scientific question is to determine the molecular mechanism of biological evolution, to a level of specificity that it can be simulated by computer, and to understand why this mechanism can do the remarkable things that it has done within the time that has been available. The talk will explore the tools needed to approach how this come from machine learning, the field that studies how mechanisms that achieve complex functionality can arise by a process of adaptation rather than design. Leslie Valiant is the T. Jefferson Coolidge Professor of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University. Valiant received his Ph.D. from Warwick University in 1974. Valiant’s work has ranged over several areas of theoretical computer science, particularly complexity theory, learning, and parallel computation. He also has interests in computational neuroscience, evolution, and artificial intelligence and is the author of two books, Circuits of the Mind (Oxford University Press, 1994) and Probably Approximately Correct (Basic Books, 2013). Valiant received the Nevanlinna Prize, the Knuth Award, the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science EATCS Award, and the A. M. Turing Award.

Multi-interface hubs correspond, in many respects, to our “classic” notion of network hubs. They are more likely to be essential and more conserved. They are most likely members of large and stable complexes. However, they do not follow canonical models of network evolution, growing through gene duplication. On the other hand, we find a second class of interactions, mutually exclusive ones, which have a transient character and occur in singlish-interface hubs.

In this paper, we, examine three important aspects of power law graphs, (1) the evolution of power law graphs, (2) the asymmetry of in-degrees and out-degrees, (3) the "scale invariance" of power law graphs. In particular, we give three increasingly general directed graph models and one general undirected graph model for generating power law graphs by adding at most one node and possibly one or more edges at a time. We show that for any given edge density and desired power laws for in-degrees and out-degrees, not necessarily the same, the resulting graph will almost surely have the desired edge density and the power laws for the in-degrees and out-degrees. Our most general directed and undirected models include nearly all known power law evolution models as special cases. Finally, we show that our evolution models generate "scale invariant" graphs. We describe a method for scaling the time in our evolution model such that the power law of the degree sequences remains invariant.},

	abstract = {There are deep, yet largely unexplored, connections between computer science and biology. Both disciplines examine how information proliferates in time and space. Central results in computer science describe the complexity of algorithms that solve certain classes of problems. An algorithm is deemed efficient if it can solve a problem in polynomial time, which means the running time of the algorithm is a polynomial function of the length of the input. There are classes of harder problems for which the fastest possible algorithm requires exponential time. Another criterion is the space requirement of the algorithm. There is a crucial distinction between algorithms that can find a solution, verify a solution, or list several distinct solutions in given time and space. The complexity hierarchy that is generated in this way is the foundation of theoretical computer science. Precise complexity results can be notoriously difficult. The famous question whether polynomial time equals nondeterministic polynomial time (i.e., P = NP) is one of the hardest open problems in computer science and all of mathematics. Here, we consider simple processes of ecological and evolutionary spatial dynamics. The basic question is: What is the probability that a new invader (or a new mutant) will take over a resident population? We derive precise complexity results for a variety of scenarios. We therefore show that some fundamental questions in this area cannot be answered by simple equations (assuming that P is not equal to NP).},

	abstract = {Large branched DNA structures are constructed by two-step reassociation of separated complementary strands from restriction fragments of different lengths. The displacement of DNA strands initially annealed to longer complementary DNA sequences, a process mediated by branch migration, is very rapid and has thus far been followed only under conditions which are second order, DNA reassociation rate limiting. The average lifetime of branched DNA leading to displacement of 1.6 Kb strands is estimated to be less than 10 seconds under conditions of DNA reassociation, Tm-25 degrees C. Several DNA-binding drugs, including intercalating dyes, have been tested to determine their influence, if any, on the kinetics of DNA strand displacements by branch migration. Only actinomycin D was found to have significant effect under the conditions we have described. The kinetics of the strand displacement in the presence of low concentrations of actinomycin D remain second order and slower rate of strand displacement must be attributed to decreased rate of reassociation of DNA strands to form the branched intermediates. Consideration is given to the potential manipulation of DNA structures at site-directed branches and the limitations due to rapid strand displacements. The feasibility of constructing sufficiently large branched DNA regions to approach first order, branch migration rate limiting kinetics is also discussed.},

Large scale experimental studies – studying the performance of a variety of optimization algorithms across a large collection of diverse problem instances – provide the resources to derive these conditions. Data mining techniques can be used to learn the relationships between the critical features of the instances and the performance of algorithms. This paper discusses how we can adequately characterize the features of a problem instance that have impact on difficulty in terms of algorithmic performance, and how such features can be defined and measured for various optimization problems. We provide a comprehensive survey of the research field with a focus on six combinatorial optimization problems: assignment, traveling salesman, and knapsack problems, bin-packing, graph coloring, and timetabling. For these problems – which are important abstractions of many real-world problems – we review hardness-revealing features as developed over decades of research, and we discuss the suitability of more problem-independent landscape metrics. We discuss how the features developed for one problem may be transferred to study related problems exhibiting similar structures.},

Here, we examine the relationship between genetic signatures of adaptive evolution and network topology. We find a striking tendency of proteins that have been under positive selection (as compared with the chimpanzee) to be located at the periphery of the interaction network. Our results are based on the analysis of two types of genome evolution, both in terms of intra- and interspecies variation. First, we looked at single-nucleotide polymorphisms and their fixed variants, single-nucleotide differences in the human genome relative to the chimpanzee. Second, we examine fixed structural variants, specifically large segmental duplications and their polymorphic precursors known as copy number variants. We propose two complementary mechanisms that lead to the observed trends. First, we can rationalize them in terms of constraints imposed by protein structure: We find that positively selected sites are preferentially located on the exposed surface of proteins. Because central network proteins (hubs) are likely to have a larger fraction of their surface involved in interactions, they tend to be constrained and under negative selection. Conversely, we show that the interaction network roughly maps to cellular organization, with the periphery of the network corresponding to the cellular periphery (i.e., extracellular space or cell membrane). This suggests that the observed positive selection at the network periphery may be due to an increase of adaptive events on the cellular periphery responding to changing environments.},

A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

	abstract = {Transcription factors bind in a combinatorial fashion to specify the on-and-off states of genes; the ensemble of these binding events forms a regulatory network, constituting the wiring diagram for a cell. To examine the principles of the human transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the genomic binding information of 119 transcription-related factors in over 450 distinct experiments. We found the combinatorial, co-association of transcription factors to be highly context specific: distinct combinations of factors bind at specific genomic locations. In particular, there are significant differences in the binding proximal and distal to genes. We organized all the transcription factor binding into a hierarchy and integrated it with other genomic information (for example, microRNA regulation), forming a dense meta-network. Factors at different levels have different properties; for instance, top-level transcription factors more strongly influence expression and middle-level ones co-regulate targets to mitigate information-flow bottlenecks. Moreover, these co-regulations give rise to many enriched network motifs (for example, noise-buffering feed-forward loops). Finally, more connected network components are under stronger selection and exhibit a greater degree of allele-specific activity (that is, differential binding to the two parental alleles). The regulatory information obtained in this study will be crucial for interpreting personal genome sequences and understanding basic principles of human biology and disease.},

	abstract = {Under appropriate conditions, specific double-stranded DNA product was generated after amplification of genomic DNA sequences in a polymerase chain-like reaction that contained only a single primer. This type of amplification reaction was performed with a variety of primers and substrate DNAs. In addition to nonspecific heterogeneous products, 5 of 11 primers reproducibly directed synthesis of double-stranded DNA that corresponded to the region of the template that contained the authentic primer annealing site. Three of these amplified products were cloned and their ends were sequenced. All three contained a copy of the primer at both 5' ends, and the position of one of the primers represented the authentic primer binding site. In each case, the location of the second copy of the primer indicated that it had initially hybridized to a partially homologous sequence in the template DNA. This single primer reaction makes it possible to amplify and clone a DNA region of unknown sequence that is adjacent to a known DNA sequence. One of the single primer reaction products described here included sequence to the 5' side of the coding region of a serotonin receptor gene that contained a functional promoter.},

	abstract = {Summary Efforts to construct synthetic networks in living cells have been hindered by the limited number of regulatory components that provide wide dynamic range and low crosstalk. Here, we report a class of de-novo-designed prokaryotic riboregulators called toehold switches that activate gene expression in response to cognate RNAs with arbitrary sequences. Toehold switches provide a high level of orthogonality and can be forward engineered to provide average dynamic range above 400. We show that switches can be integrated into the genome to regulate endogenous genes and use them as sensors that respond to endogenous RNAs. We exploit the orthogonality of toehold switches to regulate 12 genes independently and to construct a genetic circuit that evaluates 4-input AND logic. Toehold switches, with their wide dynamic range, orthogonality, and programmability, represent a versatile and powerful platform for regulation of translation, offering diverse applications in molecular biology, synthetic biology, and biotechnology.},

An interesting observation is that although many simulation systems chose to use Hill kinetics to generate data, none of the reconstruction algorithms were developed based on the Hill kinetics. One possible explanation is that, in Hill kinetics, activation and inhibition interactions take different mathematical forms, which brings additional combinatorial complexity into the reconstruction problem. We propose a new model that qualitatively behaves similar to the Hill kinetics, but has the same mathematical form for both activation and inhibition. We developed an algorithm to reconstruct gene networks based on this new model. Simulation results suggested a novel biological hypothesis that in gene knockout experiments, repressing protein synthesis to a certain extent may lead to better expression data and higher network reconstruction accuracy.},

MWUA maximizes a tradeoff between cumulative performance and entropy, which suggests a new view on the maintenance of diversity in evolution.},

Here we generalize population structure by arranging individuals on a graph. Each vertex represents an individual. The weighted edges denote reproductive rates which govern how often individuals place offspring into adjacent vertices. The homogeneous population, described by the Moran process, is the special case of a fully connected graph with evenly weighted edges. Spatial structures are described by graphs where vertices are connected with their nearest neighbours. We also explore evolution on random and scale-free networks. We determine the fixation probability of mutants, and characterize those graphs for which fixation behaviour is identical to that of a homogeneous population. Furthermore, some graphs act as suppressors and others as amplifiers of selection. It is even possible to find graphs that guarantee the fixation of any advantageous mutant. We also study frequency-dependent selection and show that the outcome of evolutionary games can depend entirely on the structure of the underlying graph. Evolutionary graph theory has many fascinating applications ranging from ecology to multi-cellular organization and economics.},

	abstract = {Genetic networks show a broad-tailed distribution of the number of interaction partners per protein, which is consistent with a power-law. It has been proposed that such broad-tailed distributions are observed because they confer robustness against mutations to the network. We evaluate this hypothesis for two genetic networks, that of the E. coli core intermediary metabolism and that of the yeast protein-interaction network. Specifically, we test the hypothesis through one of its key predictions: highly connected proteins should be more important to the cell and, thus, subject to more severe selective and evolutionary constraints. We find, however, that no correlation between highly connected proteins and evolutionary rate exists in the E. coli metabolic network and that there is only a weak correlation in the yeast protein-interaction network. Furthermore, we show that the observed correlation is function-specific within the protein-interaction network: only genes involved in the cell cycle and transcription show significant correlations. Our work sheds light on conflicting results by previous researchers by comparing data from multiple types of protein-interaction datasets and by using a closely related species as a reference taxon. The finding that highly connected proteins can tolerate just as many amino acid substitutions as other proteins leads us to conclude that power-laws in cellular networks do not reflect selection for mutational robustness.},

A possible advantage of small mean path lengths in metabolic networks stems from the importance of minimizing transition times between metabolic states in response to environmental changes (Edwards and Palsson 2000). Metabolic networks with small diameters thus might adjust more rapidly to environmental change. Answering this question by direct experimentation, however, is currently impossible, for doing so would require comparing biological networks of different large-scale structure invivo. Absent direct experimental tests showing whether genetic network diameter matters to organisms, one can still test key predictions of this hypothesis. One such prediction is that highly connected proteins should be more important to the cell and, thus, be subject to severe selective and evolutionary constraints. One way to test this prediction is to study the rate of evolution of proteins in these networks. We examine this rate in two genetic networks: the Saccharomycescerevisiae protein-interaction network (Ito et al. 2001; Uetz et al. 2000; Wagner 2001) and the Escherichiacoli metabolic network (Wagner and Fell 2001).

In order to avoid this problem it has been proposed to solve the so-called core of the problem: a Knapsack Problem defined on a small subset of the variables. The exact core cannot, however, be identified before KP is solved to optimality, thus, previous algorithms had to rely on approximate core sizes. In this paper we present an algorithm for KP where the enumerated core size is minimal, and the computational effort for sorting and reduction also is limited according to a hierarchy. The algorithm is based on a dynamic programming approach, where the core size is extended by need, and the sorting and reduction is performed in a similar “lazy” way. Computational experiments are presented for several commonly occurring types of data instances. Experience from these tests indicate that the presented approach outperforms any known algorithm for KP, having very stable solution times.},

Nevertheless, alternative approaches to modeling the Internet often make extremely different assumptions and derive opposite conclusions about fundamental properties of one and the same system. Fortunately, a detailed understanding of Internet technology combined with a unique ability to measure the network means that these differences can be understood thoroughly and resolved unambiguously. This article aims to make recent results of this process accessible beyond Internet specialists to the broader scientific community and to clarify several sources of basic methodological differences that are relevant beyond either the Internet or the two specific approaches focused on here (i.e., scale-free networks and highly optimized tolerance networks).},

The complex properties of real-world networks have a profound impact on the behavior of equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena occurring in various systems, and the study of epidemic spreading is central to our understanding of the unfolding of dynamical processes in complex networks. The theoretical analysis of epidemic spreading in heterogeneous networks requires the development of novel analytical frameworks, and it has produced results of conceptual and practical relevance. A coherent and comprehensive review of the vast research activity concerning epidemic processes is presented, detailing the successful theoretical approaches as well as making their limits and assumptions clear. Physicists, mathematicians, epidemiologists, computer, and social scientists share a common interest in studying epidemic spreading and rely on similar models for the description of the diffusion of pathogens, knowledge, and innovation. For this reason, while focusing on the main results and the paradigmatic models in infectious disease modeling, the major results concerning generalized social contagion processes are also presented. Finally, the research activity at the forefront in the study of epidemic spreading in coevolving, coupled, and time-varying networks is reported.},

Despite the fact that structure can promote the emergence of cooperation in some populations, it can suppress it in others. Thus, a detailed understanding of the influence of population structure is crucial for describing the features that allow cooperative behaviors to spread. Here, we provide a complete description of when selection favors cooperation on regular graphs under birth-death and death-birth updating for any initial configuration. We find that cooperation is never favored for birth-death updating. For death-birth updating, we derive a simple, computationally tractable formula for natural selection to favor cooperation when starting from any given initial configuration. This formula elucidates two important features concerning the emergence of cooperation: (i) the takeover of cooperation can be enhanced by the strategic placement of cooperators, and (ii) adding more cooperators to the initial configuration can sometimes suppress the evolution of cooperation.},

Process calculi provide a tool for the high-level description of interactions, communications, and synchronizations between a collection of independent agents or processes. They also provide algebraic laws that allow process descriptions to be manipulated and analyzed, and permit formal reasoning about equivalences between processes (e.g., using bisimulation). Leading examples of process calculi include CSP, CCS, ACP, and LOTOS.[1] More recent additions to the family include the π-calculus, the ambient calculus, PEPA, the fusion calculus and the join-calculus.},

Computational experiments show that most data instances are optimally solved without sorting or preprocessing a great majority of the items. Detailed program sketches are provided, and computational experiments are reported, indicating that the algorithm presented not only is shorter, but also faster and more stable than any other algorithm hitherto proposed.},

	volume = {3},
	issn = {1471-2148},
	shorttitle = {No simple dependence between protein evolution rate and the number of protein-protein interactions},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that rates of protein evolution are influenced, to a great extent, by the proportion of amino acid residues that are directly involved in protein function. In agreement with this hypothesis, recent work has shown a negative correlation between evolutionary rates and the number of protein-protein interactions. However, the extent to which the number of protein-protein interactions influences evolutionary rates remains unclear. Here, we address this question at several different levels of evolutionary relatedness. RESULTS: Manually curated data on the number of protein-protein interactions among Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins was examined for possible correlation with evolutionary rates between S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe orthologs. Only a very weak negative correlation between the number of interactions and evolutionary rate of a protein was observed. Furthermore, no relationship was found between a more general measure of the evolutionary conservation of S. cerevisiae proteins, based on the taxonomic distribution of their homologs, and the number of protein-protein interactions. However, when the proteins from yeast were assorted into discrete bins according to the number of interactions, it turned out that 6.5\% of the proteins with the greatest number of interactions evolved, on average, significantly slower than the rest of the proteins. Comparisons were also performed using protein-protein interaction data obtained with high-throughput analysis of Helicobacter pylori proteins. No convincing relationship between the number of protein-protein interactions and evolutionary rates was detected, either for comparisons of orthologs from two completely sequenced H. pylori strains or for comparisons of H. pylori and Campylobacter jejuni orthologs, even when the proteins were classified into bins by the number of interactions. CONCLUSION: The currently available comparative-genomic data do not support the hypothesis that the evolutionary rates of the majority of proteins substantially depend on the number of protein-protein interactions they are involved in. However, a small fraction of yeast proteins with the largest number of interactions (the hubs of the interaction network) tend to evolve slower than the bulk of the proteins.},

To better understand the impact of UGC systems, we have analyzed YouTube, the world's largest UGC VoD system. Based on a large amount of data collected, we provide an in-depth study of YouTube and other similar UGC systems. In particular, we study the popularity life-cycle of videos, the intrinsic statistical properties of requests and their relationship with video age, and the level of content aliasing or of illegal content in the system. We also provide insights on the potential for more efficient UGC VoD systems (e.g. utilizing P2P techniques or making better use of caching). Finally, we discuss the opportunities to leverage the latent demand for niche videos that are not reached today due to information filtering effects or other system scarcity distortions. Overall, we believe that the results presented in this paper are crucial in understanding UGC systems and can provide valuable information to ISPs, site administrators, and content owners with major commercial and technical implications.},

Metazoan evolution is marked by great morphological and physiological diversification, although the core genetic, cell biological, and developmental processes are largely conserved. Metazoan diversification has entailed the evolution of various regulatory processes controlling the time, place, and conditions of use of the conserved core processes. These regulatory processes, and certain of the core processes, have special properties relevant to evolutionary change. The properties of versatile protein elements, weak linkage, compartmentation, redundancy, and exploratory behavior reduce the interdependence of components and confer robustness and flexibility on processes during embryonic development and in adult physiology. They also confer evolvability on the organism by reducing constraints on change and allowing the accumulation of nonlethal variation. Evolvability may have been generally selected in the course of selection for robust, flexible processes suitable for complex development and physiology and specifically selected in lineages undergoing repeated radiations.},

The 1997 theorems of Wolpert and Macready are mathematically technicaland some find them unintuitive. The folkloric "no free lunch" (NFL) theorem is an easily stated and easily understood consequence of theorems Wolpert and Macready actually prove. It is weaker than the proven theorems, and thus does not encapsulate them. Various investigators have extended the work of Wolpert and Macready substantively.

There are two fundamental barriers to our ability to computationally understand the long-term behavior of a dynamical system that describes a natural process.

This is especially true for chaotic systems, where a small change in the initial conditions may cause a dramatic shift in the trajectories. The second one is Turing-completeness. By the undecidability of the Halting Problem, the long-term prospects of a system that can simulate a Turing Machine cannot be determined computationally. We investigate the interplay between these two forces -- unaccounted-for errors and Turing-completeness. We show that the introduction of even a small amount of noise into a dynamical system is sufficient to "destroy" Turing-completeness, and to make the system's long-term behavior computationally predictable. On a more technical level, we deal with long-term statistical properties of dynamical systems, as described by invariant measures. We show that while there are simple dynamical systems for which the invariant measures are non-computable, perturbing such systems makes the invariant measures efficiently computable. Thus, noise that makes the short term behavior of the system harder to predict, may make its long term statistical behavior computationally tractable. We also obtain some insight into the computational complexity of predicting systems affected by random noise.},

	abstract = {This review describes a new vision for future directions in the study of metastatic cancer biology and pathology. It is based upon clinical and experimental observations on the constituent cell lineages within a neoplasm and on tumour-host interactions. The vision incorporates information from studies in population biology, developmental biology and experimental pathology as well as investigations upon human malignant disease. The assembled information reveals that invasion and metastasis are supra-cellular manifestations of “emergent behavior” among combinations of normal and malignant cell lineages in vivo. Emergent behavior is a combinatorial interactive process in which a population displays new traits which cannot be achieved by individuals acting separately and which subside when the specific population mix disaggregates. Disruption of such pathological interactions in the field of a developing primary or secondary tumour is, therefore, required to disable the malignant population and arrest progression without tissue destruction. These conclusions originate, in part, from principles which govern the sociobiology and group behavior of bees, ants, fish, birds and human societies. In all these social organisms, external factors can disrupt signaling mechanisms and induce expanding self-perpetuating rogue behavior, leading to social disintegration. These principles also apply to cellular societies composing higher animals, which likewise need intrinsic rules to maintain social order and avoid anarchy, and recognition of this is essential for advancing future research on the mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis and metastasis. Summarised evidence is presented here to support the conclusion that miscommunications between cells and tissues in the region of the developing tumour and its metastases are the main direct perpetrators of malignant disease. Genetic lesions (mutations, deletions, translocations, reduplications, etc.), commonly seen in cancers, can significantly disrupt important molecular pathways in the networks of communications needed to sustain orderly tissue/organ structure and function. However, genetic lesions can also, themselves, be induced by abnormal cell interactions initiated by extrinsic carcinogenic agents such as chemicals, viruses, hormones and radiation. The evidence shows that, irrespective of the initiating cause, it is this miscommunication in the region of a developing tumour and its metastases that is ultimately responsible for the emergence and progression of the disease. The article describes how this information collectively, provides a framework for designing specific novel therapeutic approaches targeting the cell and tissue interactions driving tumour metastasis and its manifold effects on the whole body.},

	abstract = {Allometry is the study of the relationship of body size to shape, anatomy, physiology and finally behaviour, first outlined by Otto Snell in 1892, D'Arcy Thompson in 1917 in On Growth and Form and Julian Huxley in 1932. Allometry is a well-known study, particularly in statistical shape analysis for its theoretical developments, as well as in biology for practical applications to the differential growth rates of the parts of a living organism's body. One application is in the study of various insect species (e.g., the Hercules Beetle), where a small change in overall body size can lead to an enormous and disproportionate increase in the dimensions of appendages such as legs, antennae, or horns. The relationship between the two measured quantities is often expressed as a power law: or in a logarithmic form: where is the scaling exponent of the law. Methods for estimating this exponent from data use type 2 regressions such as major axis regression or reduced major axis regression as these account for the variation in both variables, contrary to least squares regression, which does not account for error variance in the independent variable (e.g., log body mass). Other methods include measurement error models and a particular kind of principal component analysis. Allometry often studies shape differences in terms of ratios of the objects' dimensions. Two objects of different size but common shape will have their dimensions in the same ratio. Take, for example, a biological object that grows as it matures. Its size changes with age but the shapes are similar. Studies of ontogenetic allometry often use lizards or snakes as model organisms because they lack parental care after birth or hatching and because they exhibit a large range of body size between the juvenile and adult stage. Lizards often exhibit allometric changes during their ontogeny. In addition to studies that focus on growth, allometry also examines shape variation among individuals of a given age (and sex), which is referred to as static allometry. Comparisons of species are used to examine interspecific or evolutionary allometry (see also Phylogenetic comparative methods).},

Here, we present the wiring diagram of the posterior nervous system of the C. elegans adult male, reconstructed from serial electron micrograph sections. This region of the male nervous system contains the sexually dimorphic circuits for mating. The synaptic connections, both chemical and gap junctional, form a neural network with four striking features: multiple, parallel, short synaptic pathways directly connecting sensory neurons to end organs; recurrent and reciprocal connectivity among sensory neurons; modular substructure; and interneurons acting in feedforward loops. These features help to explain how the network robustly and rapidly selects and executes the steps of a behavioral program on the basis of the inputs from multiple sensory neurons. The complete wiring structure of the synaptic network governing mating behavior of male nematodes is revealed.

The method allows delivery of peptides to a high percentage of cells in culture without effects on long-term cell viability. Permeation was confirmed microscopically by cellular uptake of a fluorescently labeled peptide and biochemically by uptake of 125I-labeled calmodulin and a 20-kD protein kinase Cε fragment into the cells. The intracellular molar concentration of the introduced peptide was ≈10\% of that applied outside. We found no significant effects of permeabilization on spontaneous, phorbol ester–modulated, or norepinephrine-modulated contraction rates. Similarly, the expression of c-fos mRNA (measured 30 minutes after permeabilization) and the incorporation of [14C]phenylalanine following agonist stimulation (measured 3 days after permeabilization) were not altered by saponin permeabilization. Finally, permeabilization of cells in the presence of a protein kinase C pseudosubstrate peptide, but not a control peptide, inhibited phorbol ester–induced [14C]phenylalanine incorporation into proteins by 80\%. Our results demonstrate a methodology for the introduction of peptides into neonatal cardiac myocytes that allows study of their actions without substantial compromises in cell integrity.},

	abstract = {Choosing appropriate primers is probably the single most important factor affecting the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Specific amplification of the intended target requires that primers do not have matches to other targets in certain orientations and within certain distances that allow undesired amplification. The process of designing specific primers typically involves two stages. First, the primers flanking regions of interest are generated either manually or using software tools; then they are searched against an appropriate nucleotide sequence database using tools such as BLAST to examine the potential targets. However, the latter is not an easy process as one needs to examine many details between primers and targets, such as the number and the positions of matched bases, the primer orientations and distance between forward and reverse primers. The complexity of such analysis usually makes this a time-consuming and very difficult task for users, especially when the primers have a large number of hits. Furthermore, although the BLAST program has been widely used for primer target detection, it is in fact not an ideal tool for this purpose as BLAST is a local alignment algorithm and does not necessarily return complete match information over the entire primer range.},

	abstract = {There are deep, yet largely unexplored, connections between computer science and biology. Both disciplines examine how information proliferates in time and space. Central results in computer science describe the complexity of algorithms that solve certain classes of problems. An algorithm is deemed efficient if it can solve a problem in polynomial time, which means the running time of the algorithm is a polynomial function of the length of the input. There are classes of harder problems for which the fastest possible algorithm requires exponential time. Another criterion is the space requirement of the algorithm. There is a crucial distinction between algorithms that can find a solution, verify a solution, or list several distinct solutions in given time and space. The complexity hierarchy that is generated in this way is the foundation of theoretical computer science. Precise complexity results can be notoriously difficult. The famous question whether polynomial time equals nondeterministic polynomial time (i.e., P = NP) is one of the hardest open problems in computer science and all of mathematics. Here, we consider simple processes of ecological and evolutionary spatial dynamics. The basic question is: What is the probability that a new invader (or a new mutant) will take over a resident population? We derive precise complexity results for a variety of scenarios. We therefore show that some fundamental questions in this area cannot be answered by simple equations (assuming that P is not equal to NP).},

These puzzling and paradoxical features are neither accidental nor artificial, but derive from a deep and necessary interplay between complexity and robustness, modularity, feedback, and fragility.

	abstract = {Comparing engineering to evolution typically involves adaptationist thinking, where well-designed artifacts are likened to well-adapted organisms, and the process of evolution is likened to the process of design. A quite different comparison is made when biologists focus on evolvability instead of adaptationism. Here, the idea is that complex integrated systems, whether evolved or engineered, share universal principles that affect the way they change over time. This shift from adaptationism to evolvability is a significant move for, as I argue, we can make sense of these universal principles without making any adaptationism claims. Furthermore, evolvability highlights important aspects of engineering that are ignored in the adaptationist debates. I introduce some novel engineering examples that incorporate these key neglected aspects, and use these examples to challenge some commonly cited contrasts between engineering and evolution, and to highlight some novel resemblances that have gone unnoticed.},

We report a whole-cell computational model of the life cycle of the human pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium that includes all of its molecular components and their interactions. An integrative approach to modeling that combines diverse mathematics enabled the simultaneous inclusion of fundamentally different cellular processes and experimental measurements. Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions. We conclude that comprehensive whole-cell models can be used to facilitate biological discovery.},

	abstract = {Despite considerable progress in genome- and proteome-based high-throughput screening methods and in rational drug design, the increase in approved drugs in the past decade did not match the increase of drug development costs. Network description and analysis not only give a systems-level understanding of drug action and disease complexity, but can also help to improve the efficiency of drug design. We give a comprehensive assessment of the analytical tools of network topology and dynamics. The state-of-the-art use of chemical similarity, protein structure, protein–protein interaction, signaling, genetic interaction and metabolic networks in the discovery of drug targets is summarized. We propose that network targeting follows two basic strategies. The “central hit strategy” selectively targets central nodes/edges of the flexible networks of infectious agents or cancer cells to kill them. The “network influence strategy” works against other diseases, where an efficient reconfiguration of rigid networks needs to be achieved by targeting the neighbors of central nodes/edges. It is shown how network techniques can help in the identification of single-target, edgetic, multi-target and allo-network drug target candidates. We review the recent boom in network methods helping hit identification, lead selection optimizing drug efficacy, as well as minimizing side-effects and drug toxicity. Successful network-based drug development strategies are shown through the examples of infections, cancer, metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Summarizing \&gt;1200 references we suggest an optimized protocol of network-aided drug development, and provide a list of systems-level hallmarks of drug quality. Finally, we highlight network-related drug development trends helping to achieve these hallmarks by a cohesive, global approach.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) form a popular optimisation paradigm inspired by natural evolution. In recent years the field of evolutionary computation has developed a rigorous analytical theory to analyse their runtime on many illustrative problems. Here we apply this theory to a simple model of natural evolution. In the Strong Selection Weak Mutation (SSWM) evolutionary regime the time between occurrence of new mutations is much longer than the time it takes for a new beneficial mutation to take over the population. In this situation, the population only contains copies of one genotype and evolution can be modelled as a (1+1)-type process where the probability of accepting a new genotype (improvements or worsenings) depends on the change in fitness. We present an initial runtime analysis of SSWM, quantifying its performance for various parameters and investigating differences to the (1+1)EA. We show that SSWM can have a moderate advantage over the (1+1)EA at crossing fitness valleys and study an example where SSWM outperforms the (1+1)EA by taking advantage of information on the fitness gradient.},

	abstract = {Macroevolution is evolution on a scale of separated gene pools. Macroevolutionary studies focus on change that occurs at or above the level of species, in contrast with microevolution, which refers to smaller evolutionary changes (typically described as changes in allele frequencies) within a species or population. Macroevolution and microevolution describe fundamentally identical processes on different time scales. The process of speciation may fall within the purview of either, depending on the forces thought to drive it. Paleontology, evolutionary developmental biology, comparative genomics and genomic phylostratigraphy contribute most of the evidence for the patterns and processes that can be classified as macroevolution. An example of macroevolution is the appearance of feathers during the evolution of birds from theropod dinosaurs. The evolutionary course of Equidae (wide family including all horses and related animals) is often viewed as a typical example of macroevolution. The earliest known genus, Hyracotherium (now reclassified as a palaeothere), was a herbivore animal resembling a dog that lived in the early Cenozoic. As its habitat transformed into an open arid grassland, selective pressure required that the animal become a fast grazer. Thus elongation of legs and head as well as reduction of toes gradually occurred, producing the only extant genus of Equidae, Equus. textasciicircum a b Matzke, Nicholas J. and Paul R. Gross. 2006.

	abstract = {Why isn’t random variation always deleterious? Are there factors that sometimes make adaptation easier? Biological systems are extraordinarily robust to perturbation by mutations, recombination and the environment. It has been proposed that this robustness might make them more evolvable. Robustness to mutation allows genetic variation to accumulate in a cryptic state. Switching mechanisms known as evolutionary capacitors mean that the amount of heritable phenotypic variation available can be correlated to the degree of stress and hence to the novelty of the environment and remaining potential for adaptation. There have been two somewhat separate literatures relating robustness to evolvability. One has focused on molecular phenotypes and new mutations, the other on morphology and cryptic genetic variation. Here, we review both literatures, and show that the true distinction is whether recombination rates are high or low. In both cases, the evidence supports the claim that robustness promotes evolvability.},

Organisms have evolved hierarchical branching networks that terminate in size-invariant units, such as capillaries, leaves, mitochondria, and oxidase molecules. Natural selection has tended to maximize both metabolic capacity, by maximizing the scaling of exchange surface areas, and internal efficiency, by minimizing the scaling of transport distances and times.

Whereas Y 0 varies with the trait and type of organism, b characteristically takes on a limited number of values, all of which are simple multiples of 1/4. For example, diameters of tree trunks and aortas scale asM 3/8 rates of cellular metabolism and heartbeat as M −1/4, blood circulation time and life span as M 1/4, and whole-organism metabolic rate as M 3/4. The question has been why these exponents are multiples of 1/4 rather than 1/3 as expected on the basis of conventional Euclidean geometric scaling.},

We present an in silico benchmark suite that we provided as a blinded, community-wide challenge within the context of the DREAM (Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods) project. We assess the performance of 29 gene-network-inference methods, which have been applied independently by participating teams. Performance profiling reveals that current inference methods are affected, to various degrees, by different types of systematic prediction errors. In particular, all but the best-performing method failed to accurately infer multiple regulatory inputs (combinatorial regulation) of genes. The results of this community-wide experiment show that reliable network inference from gene expression data remains an unsolved problem, and they indicate potential ways of network reconstruction improvements.},

Assumption that brain functionality is specified by neuronal connectivity, implemented by costly biological wiring, leads to the following optimal design problem. For a given neuronal connectivity, find a spatial layout of neurons that minimizes the wiring cost. Unfortunately, this problem is difficult to solve because the number of possible layouts is often astronomically large. We argue that the wiring cost may scale as wire length squared, reducing the optimal layout problem to a constrained minimization of a quadratic form. For biologically plausible constraints, this problem has exact analytical solutions, which give reasonable approximations to actual layouts in the brain. These solutions make the inverse problem of inferring neuronal connectivity from neuronal layout more tractable.},

	abstract = {Human physiological functions are regulated across many orders of magnitude in space and time. Integrating the information and dynamics from one scale to another is critical for the understanding of human physiology and the treatment of diseases. Multi-scale modeling, as a computational approach, has been widely adopted by researchers in computational and systems biology. A key unsolved issue is how to represent appropriately the dynamical behaviors of a high-dimensional model of a lower scale by a low-dimensional model of a higher scale, so that it can be used to investigate complex dynamical behaviors at even higher scales of integration. In the article, we first review the widely-used different modeling methodologies and their applications at different scales. We then discuss the gaps between different modeling methodologies and between scales, and discuss potential methods for bridging the gaps between scales.},

	abstract = {The brain is expensive, incurring high material and metabolic costs for its size — relative to the size of the body — and many aspects of brain network organization can be mostly explained by a parsimonious drive to minimize these costs. However, brain networks or connectomes also have high topological efficiency, robustness, modularity and a 'rich club' of connector hubs. Many of these and other advantageous topological properties will probably entail a wiring-cost premium. We propose that brain organization is shaped by an economic trade-off between minimizing costs and allowing the emergence of adaptively valuable topological patterns of anatomical or functional connectivity between multiple neuronal populations. This process of negotiating, and re-negotiating, trade-offs between wiring cost and topological value continues over long (decades) and short (millisecond) timescales as brain networks evolve, grow and adapt to changing cognitive demands. An economical analysis of neuropsychiatric disorders highlights the vulnerability of the more costly elements of brain networks to pathological attack or abnormal development.},

Here we construct and evolve a simple developmental model in which the pleiotropic effects of genes can evolve. We demonstrate that selection in a changing environment favors a specific pattern of variability, and that this favored pattern maximizes evolvability. Our analysis shows that mutant genotypes with higher evolvability are more likely to increase to fixation. We also show that populations of highly evolvable genotypes are much less likely to be invaded by mutants with lower evolvability, and that this dynamic primarily shapes evolvability. We examine several theoretical objections to the evolution of evolvability in light of this result. We also show that this result is robust to the presence or absence of recombination, and explore how nonrandom environmental change can select for a modular pattern of variability.},

Recent analyses of signaling pathways and regulatory transcription networks have revealed a common network architecture, termed scale-free topology. Although the structural properties of such networks have been thoroughly studied, their dynamical properties remain largely unexplored. We present a prototype for the study of dynamical systems to predict the functional robustness of intracellular networks against variations of their internal parameters. We demonstrate that the dynamical robustness of these complex networks is a direct consequence of their scale-free topology. By contrast, networks with homogeneous random topologies require fine-tuning of their internal parameters to sustain stable dynamical activity. Considering the ubiquity of scale-free networks in nature, we hypothesize that this topology is not only the result of aggregation processes such as preferential attachment; it may also be the result of evolutionary selective processes.},

Experiments on an existing exact algorithm and two generic solvers show that instances whose weights are uncorrelated with the profits are easier compared with weakly or strongly correlated cases. Instances with classes containing similar set of profits for items and with weights strongly correlated to the profits are the hardest among all instance groups investigated. These hard instances deserve further study and understanding their properties may shed light to better algorithms.},

In this context, the relative abundance of a network motif would reflect its adaptive value. However, although the overabundance of motifs is non-random, recent studies by Mazurie et al. and by Kuo et al. show that motif abundance does not reflect their true adaptive value.

	abstract = {The formation of a duplex between two nucleic acid strands is restricted if one of the strands forms an intra- or intermolecular secondary structure. The formation of the new duplex requires the dissociation and replacement of the initial structure. To understand the mechanism of this type of kinetics we studied the replacement of a labeled DNA oligonucleotide probe bound to a complementary DNA target with an unlabeled probe of the same sequence. The replacement kinetics were measured using a gel-shift assay for 12, 14 and 16-nucleotide probes as a function of temperature and concentration of the unlabeled probe. The results demonstrate that the overall replacement rate is a combination of two kinetic pathways: dissociative and sequential displacement. The dissociative pathway occurs by the spontaneous dissociation of the initial duplex followed by association of the target and unlabeled probe. The sequential displacement pathway requires only the partial melting of the initial duplex to allow for the formation of a branched nucleation complex with the unlabeled probe, followed by the complete displacement of the labeled probe by migration of the branch point. The contribution from the dissociative pathway is predominant at temperatures close to the melting point of the labeled probe, whereas the contribution from the displacement pathway prevails at lower temperatures and when the concentration of the replacing unlabeled probe is high. The results show that at physiological conditions, duplex formation between a single-stranded oligonucleotide probe and a structured region of a target molecule occurs mainly by the sequential-displacement mechanism.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of many social, technological and economic phenomena are driven by individual human actions, turning the quantitative understanding of human behavior into a central question of modern science. Current models of human dynamics, used from risk assessment to communications, assume that human actions are randomly distributed in time and thus well approximated by Poisson processes. Here we provide direct evidence that for five human activity patterns, such as email and letter based communications, web browsing, library visits and stock trading, the timing of individual human actions follow non-Poisson statistics, characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring events separated by long periods of inactivity. We show that the bursty nature of human behavior is a consequence of a decision based queuing process: when individuals execute tasks based on some perceived priority, the timing of the tasks will be heavy tailed, most tasks being rapidly executed, while a few experiencing very long waiting times. In contrast, priority blind execution is well approximated by uniform interevent statistics. We discuss two queuing models that capture human activity. The first model assumes that there are no limitations on the number of tasks an individual can hadle at any time, predicting that the waiting time of the individual tasks follow a heavy tailed distribution P(τw)∼τ−αw with α=3∕2. The second model imposes limitations on the queue length, resulting in a heavy tailed waiting time distribution characterized by α=1. We provide empirical evidence supporting the relevance of these two models to human activity patterns, showing that while emails, web browsing and library visitation display α=1, the surface mail based communication belongs to the α=3∕2 universality class. Finally, we discuss possible extension of the proposed queuing models and outline some future challenges in exploring the statistical mechanics of human dynamics.},

For ODE models, we explore what it takes to get oscillations out of two simple types of circuits (negative feedback loops and coupled positive and negative feedback loops). Finally, we review the procedures of linear stability analysis, which allow one to determine whether a given ODE model and a particular set of kinetic parameters will produce oscillations.},

With the use of a simple dynamical model, it was demonstrated that the cell-cycle network is extremely stable and robust for its function. The biological stationary state, the G1 state, is a global attractor of the dynamics. The biological pathway, the cell-cycle sequence of protein states, is a globally attracting trajectory of the dynamics. These properties are largely preserved with respect to small perturbations to the network. These results suggest that cellular regulatory networks are robustly designed for their functions.},

	abstract = {To facilitate precision medicine and whole-genome annotation, we developed a machine-learning technique that scores how strongly genetic variants affect RNA splicing, whose alteration contributes to many diseases. Analysis of more than 650,000 intronic and exonic variants revealed widespread patterns of mutation-driven aberrant splicing. Intronic disease mutations that are more than 30 nucleotides from any splice site alter splicing nine times as often as common variants, and missense exonic disease mutations that have the least impact on protein function are five times as likely as others to alter splicing. We detected tens of thousands of disease-causing mutations, including those involved in cancers and spinal muscular atrophy. Examination of intronic and exonic variants found using whole-genome sequencing of individuals with autism revealed misspliced genes with neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Our approach provides evidence for causal variants and should enable new discoveries in precision medicine. INTRODUCTION Advancing whole-genome precision medicine requires understanding how gene expression is altered by genetic variants, especially those that are far outside of protein-coding regions. We developed a computational technique that scores how strongly genetic variants affect RNA splicing, a critical step in gene expression whose disruption contributes to many diseases, including cancers and neurological disorders. A genome-wide analysis reveals tens of thousands of variants that alter splicing and are enriched with a wide range of known diseases. Our results provide insight into the genetic basis of spinal muscular atrophy, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, and autism spectrum disorder. RATIONALE We used “deep learning” computer algorithms to derive a computational model that takes as input DNA sequences and applies general rules to predict splicing in human tissues. Given a test variant, which may be up to 300 nucleotides into an intron, our model can be used to compute a score for how much the variant alters splicing. The model is not biased by existing disease annotations or population data and was derived in such a way that it can be used to study diverse diseases and disorders and to determine the consequences of common, rare, and even spontaneous variants. RESULTS Our technique is able to accurately classify disease-causing variants and provides insights into the role of aberrant splicing in disease. We scored more than 650,000 DNA variants and found that disease-causing variants have higher scores than common variants and even those associated with disease in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Our model predicts substantial and unexpected aberrant splicing due to variants within introns and exons, including those far from the splice site. For example, among intronic variants that are more than 30 nucleotides away from any splice site, known disease variants alter splicing nine times as often as common variants; among missense exonic disease variants, those that least affect protein function are more than five times as likely as other variants to alter splicing. Autism has been associated with disrupted splicing in brain regions, so we used our method to score variants detected using whole-genome sequencing data from individuals with and without autism. Genes with high-scoring variants include many that have previously been linked with autism, as well as new genes with known neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Most of the high-scoring variants are intronic and cannot be detected by exome analysis techniques. When we scored clinical variants in spinal muscular atrophy and colorectal cancer genes, up to 94\% of variants found to alter splicing using minigene reporters were correctly classified. CONCLUSION In the context of precision medicine, causal support for variants independent of existing whole-genome variant studies is greatly needed. Our computational model was trained to predict splicing from DNA sequence alone, without using disease annotations or population data. Consequently, its predictions are independent of and complementary to population data, GWAS, expression-based quantitative trait loci (QTL), and functional annotations of the genome. As such, our technique greatly expands the opportunities for understanding the genetic determinants of disease. View larger version: In this page In a new window Download PowerPoint Slide for Teaching “Deep learning” reveals the genetic origins of disease. A computational system mimics the biology of RNA splicing by correlating DNA elements with splicing levels in healthy human tissues. The system can scan DNA and identify damaging genetic variants, including those deep within introns. This procedure has led to insights into the genetics of autism, cancers, and spinal muscular atrophy. Predicting defects in RNA splicing Most eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are spliced to remove introns. Splicing generates uninterrupted open reading frames that can be translated into proteins. Splicing is often highly regulated, generating alternative spliced forms that code for variant proteins in different tissues. RNA-binding proteins that bind specific sequences in the mRNA regulate splicing. Xiong et al. develop a computational model that predicts splicing regulation for any mRNA sequence (see the Perspective by Guigó and Valcárcel). They use this to analyze more than half a million mRNA splicing sequence variants in the human genome. They are able to identify thousands of known disease-causing mutations, as well as many new disease candidates, including 17 new autism-linked genes.

	abstract = {Background: Metabolic abnormalities associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) are caused in part by inadequate insulin action and resulting changes in gene expression in the skeletal muscle. Two recent, independent studies of human skeletal muscle biopsies from ethnically diverse DM2 patients have identified coordinated reductions in the expression of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes. Whether these reductions are a consequence or a cause of impaired insulin sensitivity remains an open question. Methods: To address this question and to define the underlying molecular causes consistent with the expression changes reported in the muscle studies, we created a large-scale computable model to analyze the molecular actions and effects of insulin on muscle gene expression. The model enables computer-aided reasoning using over 210,000 molecular relationships assembled from the DM2 literature. Results: We integrated the data from these muscle biopsy studies into the model and used computer-aided causal reasoning to discover mechanisms that can link alterations in OXPHOS genes to decreases in glucose transport, insulin signaling, and risk factors associated to post-transplant diabetes mellitus. Conclusions: The emerging hypotheses describe biologic effects in DM2 and offer important cues for molecular targeted therapy.},

Despite therapeutic advances the overall survival rate remains low because diagnosis often occurs only at advanced stages with poor prognosis. Like in most cancers, the implementation of an early detection scheme would have a positive impact on this disease. Similarly, as oral cancer has a very high recurrence rate, the early identification of recurrence or second primary tumors is an important challenge. HNSCC detection is currently based on expert clinical examination of the upper aerodigestive tract and histologic analysis of suspicious areas, but it may be undetectable in hidden sites, and unfortunately visual screening for oral lesions is an often neglected part of dental healthcare. Our group is actively pursuing the assembly of a toolbox for the molecular analysis of oral fluid. Here we present our current status utilizing the salivary transcriptome for oral cancer diagnostics.},

Moreover, Chastain et al.'s (1) analysis is entirely deterministic, and it is known that in the absence of random drift (i.e., in infinitely large populations), recombination is only favored if there are special kinds of interaction between genes (15). Recombination is much more widely favored in finite populations, because it allows the reconstruction of combinations of genes that have been lost by chance; however, results on the deterministic MWUA do not directly address this issue, which is essentially stochastic.

	abstract = {Mathematical and theoretical biology is an interdisciplinary scientific research field with a range of applications in biology, biotechnology, and medicine. The field may be referred to as mathematical biology or biomathematics to stress the mathematical side, or as theoretical biology to stress the biological side. Mathematical biology aims at the mathematical representation, treatment and modeling of biological processes, using a variety of applied mathematical techniques and tools. It has both theoretical and practical applications in biological, biomedical and biotechnology research. For example, in cell biology, protein interactions are often represented as "cartoon" models, which, although easy to visualize, do not accurately describe the systems studied. In order to do this, precise mathematical models are required. By describing the systems in a quantitative manner, their behavior can be better simulated, and hence properties can be predicted that might not be evident to the experimenter. Such mathematical areas as calculus, probability theory, statistics, linear algebra, abstract algebra, graph theory, combinatorics, algebraic geometry, topology, dynamical systems, differential equations and coding theory are now being applied in biology. Some mathematical areas, such as certain methodologies in statistics, were developed as tools during the conduct of research into mathematical biology.},

The network is viewed as a graph whose nodes correspond to proteins. Two proteins are connected by an edge if they interact. The network resembles a random graph in that it consists of many small subnets (groups of proteins that interact with each other but do not interact with any other protein) and one large connected subnet comprising more than half of all interacting proteins. The number of interactions per protein appears to follow a power law distribution. Within approximately 200 Myr after a duplication, the products of duplicate genes become almost equally likely to (1) have common protein interaction partners and (2) be part of the same subnetwork as two proteins chosen at random from within the network. This indicates that the persistence of redundant interaction partners is the exception rather than the rule. After gene duplication, the likelihood that an interaction gets lost exceeds 2.2 × 10−3/Myr. New interactions are estimated to evolve at a rate that is approximately three orders of magnitude smaller. Every 300 Myr, as many as half of all interactions may be replaced by new interactions.},

	abstract = {Author SummaryThe modular organization of cells is not immediately obvious from the network of interacting genes, proteins, and molecules. A new window into cellular modularity is opened up by genetic data that identifies pairs of genes that interact either directly or indirectly to provide robustness to cellular function. Such pairs can map out the modular nature of a network if we understand how they relate to established mathematical clustering methods applied to networks to identify putative modules. We can test the relationship between genetically interacting pairs and modules on artificial data: large networks of interacting proteins and molecules that were evolved within an artificial chemistry and genetics, and that pass the standard tests for biological networks. Modularity evolves in these networks in order to deal with a multitude of functional goals, with a degree depending on environmental variability. Relationships between genetically interacting pairs and modules similar to those displayed by the artificial gene networks are found in the protein–protein interaction network of baker's yeast. The evolution of complex functional biological networks in silico provides an opportunity to develop and test new methods and tools to understand the complexity of biological systems at the network level.},

Here we present a general method for inferring direct effects from an observed correlation matrix containing both direct and indirect effects. We formulate the problem as the inverse of network convolution, and introduce an algorithm that removes the combined effect of all indirect paths of arbitrary length in a closed-form solution by exploiting eigen-decomposition and infinite-series sums. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in several network applications: distinguishing direct targets in gene expression regulatory networks; recognizing directly interacting amino-acid residues for protein structure prediction from sequence alignments; and distinguishing strong collaborations in co-authorship social networks using connectivity information alone. In addition to its theoretical impact as a foundational graph theoretic tool, our results suggest network deconvolution is widely applicable for computing direct dependencies in network science across diverse disciplines.

	title = {Evolutionary graph theory},

	url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_graph_theory},
	abstract = {Evolutionary graph theory is an area of research lying at the intersection of graph theory, probability theory, and mathematical biology. Evolutionary graph theory is an approach to studying how topology affects evolution of a population. That the underlying topology can substantially affect the results of the evolutionary process is seen most clearly in a paper by Erez Lieberman, Christoph Hauert and Martin Nowak. In evolutionary graph theory, individuals occupy vertices of a weighted directed graph and the weight wi j of an edge from vertex i to vertex j denotes the probability of i replacing j. The weight corresponds to the biological notion of fitness where fitter types propagate more readily. One property studied on graphs with two types of individuals is the fixation probability, which is defined as the probability that a single, randomly placed mutant of type A will replace a population of type B. According to the isothermal theorem, a graph has the same fixation probability as the corresponding Moran process if and only if it is isothermal, thus the sum of all weights that lead into a vertex is the same for all vertices. Thus, for example, a complete graph with equal weights describes a Moran process. The fixation probability is ρ M = 1 − r − 1 1 − r − N \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle \{{\textbackslash}begin\{aligned\}{\textbackslash}rho \_\{M\}=\{{\textbackslash}frac \{1-rtextasciicircum\{-1\}\}\{1-rtextasciicircum\{-N\}\}\}{\textbackslash}end\{aligned\}\}\} where r is the relative fitness of the invading type. Graphs can be classified into amplifiers of selection and suppressors of selection. If the fixation probability of a single advantageous mutation ρ G \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}rho \_\{G\}\} is higher than the fixation probability of the corresponding Moran process ρ M \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}rho \_\{M\}\} then the graph is an amplifier, otherwise a suppressor of selection. One example of the suppressor of selection is a linear process where only vertex i-1 can replace vertex i (but not the other way around). In this case the fixation probability is ρ G = 1 / N \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}rho \_\{G\}=1/N\} (where N is the number of vertices) since this is the probability that the mutation arises in the first vertex which will eventually replace all the other ones. Since ρ G textless ρ M \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}rho \_\{G\}textless{\textbackslash}rho \_\{M\}\} for all r greater than 1, this graph is by definition a suppressor of selection. Evolutionary graph theory may also be studied in a dual formulation, as a coalescing random walk. Also evolutionary games can be studied on graphs where again an edge between i and j means that these two individuals will play a game against each other. Closely related stochastic processes include the voter model, which was introduced by Clifford and Sudbury (1973) and independently by Holley and Liggett (1975), and which has been studied extensively.},

It also includes components like Internet exchange points. By its very definition, each and every aspect of this system is impacted by BGP, the de-facto standard inter-domain routing protocol. The element of this inter-domain routing system that has attracted the single-most attention within the research community has been the "inter-domain topology". Unfortunately, almost from the get go, the vast majority of studies of this topology, from definition, to measurement, to modeling and analysis, have ignored the central role of BGP in this problem. The legacy is a set of specious findings, unsubstantiated claims, and ill-conceived ideas about the Internet as a whole. By presenting a BGP-focused state-of-the-art treatment of the aspects that are critical for a rigorous study of this inter-domain topology, we demystify in this paper many "controversial" observations reported in the existing literature. At the same time, we illustrate the benefits and richness of new scientific approaches to measuring, modeling, and analyzing the inter-domain topology that are faithful to the BGP-specific nature of this problem domain.},

	abstract = {Power laws and distributions with heavy tails are common features of many complex systems. Examples are the distribution of earthquake magnitudes, solar flare intensities and the sizes of neuronal avalanches. Previously, researchers surmised that a single general concept may act as an underlying generative mechanism, with the theory of self organized criticality being a weighty contender. The power-law scaling observed in the primary statistical analysis is an important, but by far not the only feature characterizing experimental data. The scaling function, the distribution of energy fluctuations, the distribution of inter-event waiting times, and other higher order spatial and temporal correlations, have seen increased consideration over the last years. Leading to realization that basic models, like the original sandpile model, are often insufficient to adequately describe the complexity of real-world systems with power-law distribution. Consequently, a substantial amount of effort has gone into developing new and extended models and, hitherto, three classes of models have emerged. The first line of models is based on a separation between the time scales of an external drive and an internal dissipation, and includes the original sandpile model and its extensions, like the dissipative earthquake model. Within this approach the steady state is close to criticality in terms of an absorbing phase transition. The second line of models is based on external drives and internal dynamics competing on similar time scales and includes the coherent noise model, which has a non-critical steady state characterized by heavy-tailed distributions. The third line of models proposes a non-critical self-organizing state, being guided by an optimization principle, such as the concept of highly optimized tolerance. We present a comparative overview regarding distinct modeling approaches together with a discussion of their potential relevance as underlying generative models for real-world phenomena. The complexity of physical and biological scaling phenomena has been found to transcend the explanatory power of individual paradigmal concepts. The interaction between theoretical development and experimental observations has been very fruitful, leading to a series of novel concepts and insights.},

	abstract = {Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONGenetic interactions occur when mutations in two or more genes combine to generate an unexpected phenotype. An extreme negative or synthetic lethal genetic interaction occurs when two mutations, neither lethal individually, combine to cause cell death. Conversely, positive genetic interactions occur when two mutations produce a phenotype that is less severe than expected. Genetic interactions identify functional relationships between genes and can be harnessed for biological discovery and therapeutic target identification. They may also explain a considerable component of the undiscovered genetics associated with human diseases. Here, we describe construction and analysis of a comprehensive genetic interaction network for a eukaryotic cell. RATIONALEGenome sequencing projects are providing an unprecedented view of genetic variation. However, our ability to interpret genetic information to predict inherited phenotypes remains limited, in large part due to the extensive buffering of genomes, making most individual eukaryotic genes dispensable for life. To explore the extent to which genetic interactions reveal cellular function and contribute to complex phenotypes, and to discover the general principles of genetic networks, we used automated yeast genetics to construct a global genetic interaction network. RESULTSWe tested most of the {\textasciitilde}6000 genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for all possible pairwise genetic interactions, identifying nearly 1 million interactions, including {\textasciitilde}550,000 negative and {\textasciitilde}350,000 positive interactions, spanning {\textasciitilde}90\% of all yeast genes. Essential genes were network hubs, displaying five times as many interactions as nonessential genes. The set of genetic interactions or the genetic interaction profile for a gene provides a quantitative measure of function, and a global network based on genetic interaction profile similarity revealed a hierarchy of modules reflecting the functional architecture of a cell. Negative interactions connected functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive interactions often mapped general regulatory connections associated with defects in cell cycle progression or cellular proteostasis. Importantly, the global network illustrates how coherent sets of negative or positive genetic interactions connect protein complex and pathways to map a functional wiring diagram of the cell. CONCLUSIONA global genetic interaction network highlights the functional organization of a cell and provides a resource for predicting gene and pathway function. This network emphasizes the prevalence of genetic interactions and their potential to compound phenotypes associated with single mutations. Negative genetic interactions tend to connect functionally related genes and thus may be predicted using alternative functional information. Although less functionally informative, positive interactions may provide insights into general mechanisms of genetic suppression or resiliency. We anticipate that the ordered topology of the global genetic network, in which genetic interactions connect coherently within and between protein complexes and pathways, may be exploited to decipher genotype-to-phenotype relationships. textlessimg class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/353/6306/aaf1420/F1.medium.gif"/textgreater Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint A global network of genetic interaction profile similarities.(Left) Genes with similar genetic interaction profiles are connected in a global network, such that genes exhibiting more similar profiles are located closer to each other, whereas genes with less similar profiles are positioned farther apart. (Right) Spatial analysis of functional enrichment was used to identify and color network regions enriched for similar Gene Ontology bioprocess terms. We generated a global genetic interaction network for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, constructing more than 23 million double mutants, identifying about 550,000 negative and about 350,000 positive genetic interactions. This comprehensive network maps genetic interactions for essential gene pairs, highlighting essential genes as densely connected hubs. Genetic interaction profiles enabled assembly of a hierarchical model of cell function, including modules corresponding to protein complexes and pathways, biological processes, and cellular compartments. Negative interactions connected functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive interactions often mapped general regulatory connections among gene pairs, rather than shared functionality. The global network illustrates how coherent sets of genetic interactions connect protein complex and pathway modules to map a functional wiring diagram of the cell.},

	abstract = {Valency and bonding on a larger scale In molecular systems, valency describes the number of bonds an atom can make with its neighbors. Larger objects such as colloids can be linked together to make connected structures in which the number of connections, or valency, is controlled by the central object. Jones et al. review the two main approaches to creating stiff bonds, based on DNA-based materials synthesis. These approaches allow the construction of molecular-like objects from building blocks much larger than single atoms. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1260901 Structured Abstract BACKGROUND Nucleic acids are ubiquitous in biology because of their ability to encode vast amounts of information via canonical Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions. With the advent of chemical methods to make synthetic oligonucleotides of an arbitrary sequence, researchers can program entire libraries of molecules with orthogonal interactions, directed to assemble in highly specific arrangements. Early attempts to use DNA to make nanostructures led to topologically defined architectures, but ones that were too conformationally flexible to be used to guide the construction of well-defined nanoscale materials from the bottom up. In this Review, we discuss the key discoveries that have overcome this limitation and distill common design principles that have since led to a revolution in materials sophistication based on DNA-directed assembly. ADVANCES The experimental realization of DNA-based constructs that are sufficiently rigid so as to impart directionality to hybridization interactions marks a major milestone in the development of programmable materials assembly. This feat was accomplished simultaneously by the Mirkin Group and Seeman Group in 1996, but through chemically and conceptually distinct pathways. In one approach, rigidity is derived from multiple strand crossover events and the hybridization that stabilizes them to create a conformationally restricted DNA tile. In the other approach, a rigid non-nucleic acid–based nanoparticle (inorganic or organic) core acts as a template to organize functionalized DNA strands in a surface-normal orientation. It is appealing to draw the analogy between DNA-based constructs of this sort with the concepts of “bonds” and “valency” found in atomic systems. Just as understanding the nature of atomic bonding is crucial for chemists to manipulate the formation of molecular and supramolecular species, so too is an understanding of the nature of these DNA bonding modes necessary for nanoscientists to build complex and functional architectures to address materials needs. OUTLOOK The interest in nanoscale materials constructed by using DNA bonds has continued to grow steadily, but has seen a noteworthy explosion in relevance over the past several years. This is due in large part to the development of methods to move beyond simple clusters and crystals to more sophisticated nanostructured materials that are dynamic and stimuli responsive, are macroscopic in spatial extent, and exhibit emergent physical properties that arise from specific arrangements of matter. These techniques offer perhaps the most versatile way of organizing optically active materials into architectures that exhibit unusual and deliberately tailorable plasmonic and photonic properties. In addition, prospects include the use of these materials in biological settings, being that they are constructed, in large measure, from nucleic acid precursors. The ability to manipulate gene expression, deliver molecular payloads via DNA-based binding events, and detect relevant markers of disease with nanoscale spatial resolution represent some of the most fruitful avenues of future research. textlessimg class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/347/6224/1260901/F1.medium.gif"/textgreater Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Differentiating nanoscale DNA bonds. (A) Multiple strand crossover events and DNA hybridization produce a conformationally constrained molecule with a rigid core. (B) A rigid nanoparticle acts as a scaffold for the immobilization and organization of DNA strands in a surface-normal direction. For over half a century, the biological roles of nucleic acids as catalytic enzymes, intracellular regulatory molecules, and the carriers of genetic information have been studied extensively. More recently, the sequence-specific binding properties of DNA have been exploited to direct the assembly of materials at the nanoscale. Integral to any methodology focused on assembling matter from smaller pieces is the idea that final structures have well-defined spacings, orientations, and stereo-relationships. This requirement can be met by using DNA-based constructs that present oriented nanoscale bonding elements from rigid core units. Here, we draw analogy between such building blocks and the familiar chemical concepts of “bonds” and “valency” and review two distinct but related strategies that have used this design principle in constructing new configurations of matter.},

The rates of these processes can be estimated from available Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome data and are sufficiently high to affect network structure on short time-scales. For instance, more than 100 interactions may be added to the yeast network every million years, a fraction of which adds previously unconnected proteins to the network. Highly connected proteins show a greater rate of interaction turnover than proteins with few interactions. From these observations one can explain (without natural selection on global network structure) the evolutionary sustenance of the most prominent network feature, the distribution of the frequency P(d) of proteins with d neighbours, which is broad-tailed and consistent with a power law, that is: P(d) α d -γ.},

Therefore, it is important to investigate the evolution of biological networks in terms of network rewiring. Understanding how biological networks evolve could eventually help explain the general mechanism of cellular system. In the past decade, a large amount of high-throughput experiments have helped to unravel the different types of networks in a number of species. Recent studies have provided evolutionary rate calculations on individual networks and observed different rewiring rates between them. We have chosen a systematic approach to compare rewiring rate differences among the common types of biological networks utilizing experimental data across species. Our analysis shows that regulatory networks generally evolve faster than non-regulatory collaborative networks. Our analysis also highlights future applications of the approach to address other interesting biological questions.},

One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as “modularity” over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times.

Understanding genotype-phenotype relationships requires that phenotypes be viewed as manifestations of network properties, rather than simply as the result of individual genomic variations. Genome sequencing efforts have identified numerous germline mutations associated with cancer predisposition and large numbers of somatic genomic alterations. However, it remains challenging to distinguish between background, or “passenger” and causal, or “driver” cancer mutations in these datasets. Human viruses intrinsically depend on their host cell during the course of infection and can elicit pathological phenotypes similar to those arising from mutations. To test the hypothesis that genomic variations and tumour viruses may cause cancer via related mechanisms, we systematically examined host interactome and transcriptome network perturbations caused by DNA tumour virus proteins. The resulting integrated viral perturbation data reflects rewiring of the host cell networks, and highlights pathways that go awry in cancer, such as Notch signalling and apoptosis. We show that systematic analyses of host targets of viral proteins can identify cancer genes with a success rate on par with their identification through functional genomics and large-scale cataloguing of tumour mutations. Together, these complementary approaches result in increased specificity for cancer gene identification. Combining systems-level studies of pathogen-encoded gene products with genomic approaches will facilitate prioritization of cancer-causing driver genes so as to advance understanding of the genetic basis of human cancer.},

It differs from the Negative Binomial Distribution in that lack of success, being a non-event, is not punished by increased chance of failure. It is shown that such a stochastic law is governed by the Beta Function, containing only one free parameter, and this is approximated by a skew or hyperbolic distribution of the type that is widespread in bibliometrics and diverse social science phenomena. In particular, this is shown to be an appropriate underlying probabilistic theory for the Bradford Law, the Lotka Law, the Pareto and Zipf Distributions, and for all the empirical results of citation frequency analysis. As side results one may derive also the obsolescence factor for literature use. The Beta Function is peculiarly elegant for these manifold purposes because it yields both the actual and the cumulative distributions in simple form, and contains a limiting case of an inverse square law to which many empirical distributions conform.},

Immunohistochemistry and DNA in situ hybridization (ISH) are widely used in clinical settings to assess protein and DNA biomarkers, respectively, but clinical use of in situ RNA analysis is rare. This disparity is especially notable when considering the abundance of RNA biomarkers discovered through whole-genome expression profiling. This is largely due to the high degree of technical complexity and insufficient sensitivity and specificity of current RNA ISH techniques. Here, we describe RNAscope, a novel RNA ISH technology with a unique probe design strategy that allows simultaneous signal amplification and background suppression to achieve single-molecule visualization while preserving tissue morphology. RNAscope is compatible with routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens and can use either conventional chromogenic dyes for bright-field microscopy or fluorescent dyes for multiplex analysis. Unlike grind-and-bind RNA analysis methods such as real-time RT-PCR, RNAscope brings the benefits of in situ analysis to RNA biomarkers and may enable rapid development of RNA ISH-based molecular diagnostic assays.},

Genes and gene products function not in isolation but as components of intricate networks of macromolecules (DNA, RNA, or proteins) and metabolites linked through biochemical or physical interactions, represented in 'interactome' network models as 'nodes' and 'edges', respectively. Accordingly, mechanistic understanding of human disease will require understanding of how disease-causing mutations affect systems or interactome properties. The study of 'edgetics' uncovers specific loss or gain of interactions (edges) to interpret genotype-to-phenotype relationships. We review how distinct genetic variants, the genotype, lead to distinct phenotypic outcomes, the phenotype, through edgetic perturbations in interactome networks altogether representing the 'edgotype'.},

	abstract = {Allometry is the study of the relationship of body size to shape, anatomy, physiology and finally behaviour, first outlined by Otto Snell in 1892, D'Arcy Thompson in 1917 in On Growth and Form and Julian Huxley in 1932. Allometry is a well-known study, particularly in statistical shape analysis for its theoretical developments, as well as in biology for practical applications to the differential growth rates of the parts of a living organism's body. One application is in the study of various insect species (e.g., the Hercules Beetle), where a small change in overall body size can lead to an enormous and disproportionate increase in the dimensions of appendages such as legs, antennae, or horns. The relationship between the two measured quantities is often expressed as a power law: or in a logarithmic form: where is the scaling exponent of the law. Methods for estimating this exponent from data use type 2 regressions such as major axis regression or reduced major axis regression as these account for the variation in both variables, contrary to least squares regression, which does not account for error variance in the independent variable (e.g., log body mass). Other methods include measurement error models and a particular kind of principal component analysis. Allometry often studies shape differences in terms of ratios of the objects' dimensions. Two objects of different size but common shape will have their dimensions in the same ratio. Take, for example, a biological object that grows as it matures. Its size changes with age but the shapes are similar. Studies of ontogenetic allometry often use lizards or snakes as model organisms because they lack parental care after birth or hatching and because they exhibit a large range of body size between the juvenile and adult stage. Lizards often exhibit allometric changes during their ontogeny. In addition to studies that focus on growth, allometry also examines shape variation among individuals of a given age (and sex), which is referred to as static allometry. Comparisons of species are used to examine interspecific or evolutionary allometry (see also Phylogenetic comparative methods).},

The state-of-the-art use of chemical similarity, protein structure, protein–protein interaction, signaling, genetic interaction and metabolic networks in the discovery of drug targets is summarized. We propose that network targeting follows two basic strategies. The “central hit strategy” selectively targets central nodes/edges of the flexible networks of infectious agents or cancer cells to kill them. The “network influence strategy” works against other diseases, where an efficient reconfiguration of rigid networks needs to be achieved by targeting the neighbors of central nodes/edges. It is shown how network techniques can help in the identification of single-target, edgetic, multi-target and allo-network drug target candidates. We review the recent boom in network methods helping hit identification, lead selection optimizing drug efficacy, as well as minimizing side-effects and drug toxicity. Successful network-based drug development strategies are shown through the examples of infections, cancer, metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Summarizing textgreater1200 references we suggest an optimized protocol of network-aided drug development, and provide a list of systems-level hallmarks of drug quality. Finally, we highlight network-related drug development trends helping to achieve these hallmarks by a cohesive, global approach.},

Here we analysed 264 complete genomes from 12 Escherichia coli populations to characterize their dynamics over 50,000 generations. The populations that retained the ancestral mutation rate support a model in which most fixed mutations are beneficial, the fraction of beneficial mutations declines as fitness rises, and neutral mutations accumulate at a constant rate. We also compared these populations to mutation-accumulation lines evolved under a bottlenecking regime that minimizes selection. Nonsynonymous mutations, intergenic mutations, insertions and deletions are overrepresented in the long-term populations, further supporting the inference that most mutations that reached high frequency were favoured by selection. These results illuminate the shifting balance of forces that govern genome evolution in populations adapting to a new environment.},

However, it seems that many of these areas have been relatively closed to outsiders. In this contribution, we aim to compare and highlight the different perspectives and contributions from these fields, with emphasis on two key questions: (i) why are reverse engineering problems so hard to solve, and (ii) what methods are available for the particular problems arising from systems biology?},

	abstract = {Transcription factors bind in a combinatorial fashion to specify the on-and-off states of genes; the ensemble of these binding events forms a regulatory network, constituting the wiring diagram for a cell. To examine the principles of the human transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the genomic binding information of 119 transcription-related factors in over 450 distinct experiments. We found the combinatorial, co-association of transcription factors to be highly context specific: distinct combinations of factors bind at specific genomic locations. In particular, there are significant differences in the binding proximal and distal to genes. We organized all the transcription factor binding into a hierarchy and integrated it with other genomic information (for example, microRNA regulation), forming a dense meta-network. Factors at different levels have different properties; for instance, top-level transcription factors more strongly influence expression and middle-level ones co-regulate targets to mitigate information-flow bottlenecks. Moreover, these co-regulations give rise to many enriched network motifs (for example, noise-buffering feed-forward loops). Finally, more connected network components are under stronger selection and exhibit a greater degree of allele-specific activity (that is, differential binding to the two parental alleles). The regulatory information obtained in this study will be crucial for interpreting personal genome sequences and understanding basic principles of human biology and disease. View full text},

A series of studies has identified key principles controlling the growth and the dynamics of scale-free networks. Here, we use neuron-based networks of boolean components as a framework for modelling a large class of dynamical behaviours in both natural and artificial systems. Applying a training algorithm, we characterize how networks with distinct topologies evolve towards a pre-established target function through a process of random mutations and selection. We find that homogeneous random networks and scale-free networks exhibit drastically different evolutionary paths. Whereas homogeneous random networks accumulate neutral mutations and evolve by sparse punctuated steps, scale-free networks evolve rapidly and continuously. Remarkably, this latter property is robust to variations of the degree exponent. In contrast, homogeneous random networks require a specific tuning of their connectivity to optimize their ability to evolve. These results highlight an organizing principle that governs the evolution of complex networks and that can improve the design of engineered systems.},

	abstract = {Author Summary Network analyses of large-scale interactomes have been a great aid in advancing our understanding of cellular functioning and organization. Here, we examine one of the most basic and intensely-studied structure-to-function relationships observed in cellular networks: that between the number of interactions a protein has and its tendency to be essential. We develop a new computational framework to systematically analyze essential proteins within their cellular context by explicitly incorporating functional information. We apply this framework to the yeast interactome and demonstrate that the previously observed positive relationship between interaction degree and essentiality is largely due to intramodular interactions. Further, essentiality appears to be a modular property of protein complexes and not more broadly of biological processes. Within an essential complex, its essential proteins tend to have more interactions, especially intra-complex interactions, than its non-essential proteins. Finally, in a computationally inferred module-level interaction network, essential complexes and processes tend to have higher interaction degrees than their non-essential counterparts. In summary, we show a relationship between connectivity and essentiality not only at the protein level, but also within modules and at the module level, with complexes and processes that are essential tending to interact with many functional groups.},

However, it is an underdetermined problem, as the number of interactions that can be inferred exceeds the number of independent measurements. Different state-of-the-art tools for network inference use specific assumptions and simplifications to deal with underdetermination, and these influence the inferences. The outcome of network inference therefore varies between tools and can be highly complementary. Here we categorize the available tools according to the strategies that they use to deal with the problem of underdetermination. Such categorization allows an insight into why a certain tool is more appropriate for the specific research question or data set at hand.},

	abstract = {Biological gene networks appear to be dynamically robust to mutation, stochasticity, and changes in the environment and also appear to be sparsely connected. Studies with computational models, however, have suggested that denser gene networks evolve to be more dynamically robust than sparser networks. We resolve this discrepancy by showing that misassumptions about how to measure robustness in artificial networks have inadvertently discounted the costs of network complexity. We show that when the costs of complexity are taken into account, that robustness implies a parsimonious network structure that is sparsely connected and not unnecessarily complex; and that selection will favor sparse networks when network topology is free to evolve. Because a robust system of heredity is necessary for the adaptive evolution of complex phenotypes, the maintenance of frugal network complexity is likely a crucial design constraint that underlies biological organization.},

	abstract = {Novel protein-coding genes can arise either through re-organization of pre-existing genes or de novo,. Processes involving re-organization of pre-existing genes, notably following gene duplication, have been extensively described,. In contrast, de novo gene birth remains poorly understood, mainly because translation of sequences devoid of genes, or “non-genic” sequences, is expected to produce insignificant polypeptides rather than proteins with specific biological functions,-. Here, we formalize an evolutionary model according to which functional genes evolve de novo through transitory proto-genes generated by widespread translational activity in non-genic sequences. Testing this model at genome-scale in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we detect translation of hundreds of short species-specific open reading frames (ORFs) located in non-genic sequences. These translation events appear to provide adaptive potential, as suggested by their differential regulation upon stress and by signatures of retention by natural selection. In line with our model, we establish that S. cerevisiae ORFs can be placed within an evolutionary continuum ranging from non-genic sequences to genes. We identify {\textasciitilde}1,900 candidate proto-genes among S. cerevisiae ORFs and find that de novo gene birth from such a reservoir may be more prevalent than sporadic gene duplication. Our work illustrates that evolution exploits seemingly dispensable sequences to generate adaptive functional innovation.},

By this logic, if I spend 2 hours coding up a little computer program that can take in some sensory data and do some basic prediction, my computer program is conscious? The reason no one takes new theories about consciousness seriously (this one will be included, just like the 20 others published in the last year) is because they all claim to have “solved” the problem, or at least come up with a “novel” way of looking at the problem, without answering ANY of the hugely difficult mysteries about the true nature of consciousness that anyone in the field ACTUALLY cares about. I’m not going to spell out all of the questions that need to be answered, there are too many. But you can’t just say “it’s inference!” and think that you’ve contributed anything meaningful to the discussion. The REAL problems (unity, qualia, correlation to biology, causal/non-causal, and dozens more huge mysteries) are never even remotely touched by any of these new theories. Not by Graziano, not by Anil Seth, certainly not by Sean Carroll (it’s a ‘way of talking’?? really??), and not by this theory. This is all stuff that an undergraduate psychology or biology major could come up with, but they don’t write essays about it because they are at least capable understanding their own ignorance on the subject. Stop giving us theories and start giving us **explanations**. Call it whatever you want! Inference, stories, attractors, complexity, illusion, microtubules, wave function collapse, fairy magic. If your explanation is good, you will be able to **build** a conscious being because your theory works. None of these work (as explanations of consciousness).

To examine the principles of the human transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the genomic binding information of 119 transcription-related factors in over 450 distinct experiments. We found the combinatorial, co-association of transcription factors to be highly context specific: distinct combinations of factors bind at specific genomic locations. In particular, there are significant differences in the binding proximal and distal to genes. We organized all the transcription factor binding into a hierarchy and integrated it with other genomic information (for example, microRNA regulation), forming a dense meta-network. Factors at different levels have different properties; for instance, top-level transcription factors more strongly influence expression and middle-level ones co-regulate targets to mitigate information-flow bottlenecks. Moreover, these co-regulations give rise to many enriched network motifs (for example, noise-buffering feed-forward loops). Finally, more connected network components are under stronger selection and exhibit a greater degree of allele-specific activity (that is, differential binding to the two parental alleles). The regulatory information obtained in this study will be crucial for interpreting personal genome sequences and understanding basic principles of human biology and disease.},

Here we construct and evolve a simple developmental model in which the pleiotropic effects of genes can evolve. We demonstrate that selection in a changing environment favors a specific pattern of variability, and that this favored pattern maximizes evolvability. Our analysis shows that mutant genotypes with higher evolvability are more likely to increase to fixation. We also show that populations of highly evolvable genotypes are much less likely to be invaded by mutants with lower evolvability, and that this dynamic primarily shapes evolvability. We examine several theoretical objections to the evolution of evolvability in light of this result. We also show that this result is robust to the presence or absence of recombination, and explore how nonrandom environmental change can select for a modular pattern of variability.},

	abstract = {A key question in biological systems is whether genetic diversity persists in the long run under evolutionary competition or whether a single dominant genotype emerges. Classic work by Kalmus in 1945 has established that even in simple diploid species (species with two chromosomes) diversity can be guaranteed as long as the heterozygote individuals enjoy a selective advantage. Despite the classic nature of the problem, as we move towards increasingly polymorphic traits (e.g. human blood types) predicting diversity and understanding its implications is still not fully understood. Our key contribution is to establish complexity theoretic hardness results implying that even in the textbook case of single locus diploid models predicting whether diversity survives or not given its fitness landscape is algorithmically intractable. We complement our results by establishing that under randomly chosen fitness landscapes diversity survives with significant probability. Our results are structurally robust along several dimensions (e.g., choice of parameter distribution, different definitions of stability/persistence, restriction to typical subclasses of fitness landscapes). Technically, our results exploit connections between game theory, nonlinear dynamical systems, complexity theory and biology and establish hardness results for predicting the evolution of a deterministic variant of the well known multiplicative weights update algorithm in symmetric coordination games which could be of independent interest.},

Our goal is to evaluate the role of design thinking in non-evolutionary analyses. Specifically, we focus on research into abstract design principles that underpin the functional organization of extant organisms. Drawing on case studies from engineering-inspired approaches in biology we show how optimality analysis, and other design-related methods, play a specific methodological role that is tangential to the study of adaptation. To account for the role of these reasoning strategies in contemporary biology, we therefore suggest a reevaluation of the connection between design thinking and adaptationism.},

Such a mutually beneficial process is made possible by specific architectural features observed in robust systems.

	abstract = {In the biological sciences, the term bow tie (so called for its shape) is a recent concept that tries to grasp the essence of some operational and functional structures observed in biological organisms and other kinds of complex and self-organizing systems. In general, bow tie architectures refer to ordered and recurrent structures that often underlie complex technological or biological systems, and that are capable of conferring them a balance among efficiency, robustness and evolvability. In other words, bow ties are able to take into account a great diversity of inputs (fanning in to the knot), showing a much smaller diversity in the protocols and processes (the knot) able to elaborate these inputs, and finally an extremely heterogeneous diversity of outputs (fanning out of the bowtie). These architectures thus manage a wide range of inputs through a core (knot) constituted by a limited number of elements. In such structures, inputs are conveyed into a sort of funnel, towards a "synthesis" core, where they can be duly organized, processed and managed by means of protocols [1], and from where, in turn, a variety of outputs, or responses, is propagated. According to Csete and Doyle, bow ties are able to optimally organize fluxes of mass, energy, signals in an overall structure that forcedly deals with a highly fluctuating and "sloppy" environment. In a biological perspective, a bow tie manages a large fan in of stimuli (input), it accounts for a "compressed" core, and it expresses again a large fan out of possible phenotypes, metabolite products, or –more generally – reusable modules. Bow tie architectures have been observed in the structural organization at different scales of living and evolving organisms (e.g. bacterial metabolism network) as well as in technological and dynamical systems (e.g. the Internet). Bow ties seem to be able to mediate trade-offs among robustness and efficiency, at the same time assuring to the system the capability to evolve. Conversely, the same efficient architecture may be prone and vulnerable to fragilities due to specific changes, perturbations, and focused attacks directed against the core set of modules and protocols. The bow tie architecture is one of several different structures and functioning principles that living matter employs to achieve self-organization and efficient exploitation of available resources.},

Current models of human dynamics, used from risk assessment to communications, assume that human actions are randomly distributed in time and thus well approximated by Poisson processes. In contrast, there is increasing evidence that the timing of many human activities, ranging from communication to entertainment and work patterns, follow non-Poisson statistics, characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring events separated by long periods of inactivity. Here I show that the bursty nature of human behaviour is a consequence of a decision-based queuing process: when individuals execute tasks based on some perceived priority, the timing of the tasks will be heavy tailed, with most tasks being rapidly executed, whereas a few experience very long waiting times. In contrast, random or priority blind execution is well approximated by uniform inter-event statistics. These finding have important implications, ranging from resource management to service allocation, in both communications and retail.},

Because post-genomics research is taking place throughout the tree of life, comparative approaches offer a way for combining data from many organisms to shed light on the evolution and function of biological networks from the gene to the organismal level. Therefore, systems biology can build on decades of theoretical work in evolutionary biology, and at the same time evolutionary biology can use the systems biology approach to go in new uncharted directions. In this study, we present a review of how the post-genomics era is adopting comparative approaches and dynamic system methods to understand the underlying design principles of network evolution and to shape the nascent field of evolutionary systems biology.

	abstract = {Author Summary Proving that research findings from in vitro or animal models are relevant to human diseases is a major bottleneck in medical science. Hundreds of researchers have suggested the human relevance of oncogenic mechanisms from the statistical association between gene expression markers of these mechanisms and disease outcome. Such evidence has become easier to obtain recently with the advent of microarray screens and of large public-domain genome-wide expression datasets with patient follow-up. We demonstrated that in breast cancer any set of 100 genes or more selected at random has a 90\% chance to be significantly associated with outcome. Thus, investigators are bound to find an association however whimsical their marker is. For example, we could establish outcome associations for a signature of postprandial laughter and a signature of social defeat in mice. Association was not stronger than expected at random for 28 (60\%) of 47 published breast cancer signatures. The odds of association are 5–17\% with random single gene markers—a finding relevant to older breast cancer studies. We explained these results by showing that much of the breast cancer transcriptome is correlated with proliferation, which integrates most prognostic information in this disease.},

The integration of network analysis and dynamic modeling enables one to investigate the behavior of the underlying system as a whole and to make experimentally testable predictions about less-understood aspects of the processes involved. In this paper, we present a tutorial on the fundamental steps of Boolean modeling of biological regulatory networks. We demonstrate how to infer a Boolean network model from the available experimental data, analyze the network using graph-theoretical measures, and convert it into a predictive dynamic model. For each step, the pitfalls one may encounter and possible ways to circumvent them are also discussed. We illustrate these steps on a toy network as well as in the context of the Drosophila melanogaster segment polarity gene network.},

	abstract = {The “classical” random graph models, in particular G(n,p), are “homogeneous,” in the sense that the degrees (for example) tend to be concentrated around a typical value. Many graphs arising in the real world do not have this property, having, for example, power-law degree distributions. Thus there has been a lot of recent interest in defining and studying “inhomogeneous” random graph models. One of the most studied properties of these new models is their “robustness”, or, equivalently, the “phase transition” as an edge density parameter is varied. For G(n,p), p = c/n, the phase transition at c = 1 has been a central topic in the study of random graphs for well over 40 years. Many of the new inhomogeneous models are rather complicated; although there are exceptions, in most cases precise questions such as determining exactly the critical point of the phase transition are approachable only when there is independence between the edges. Fortunately, some models studied have this property already, and others can be approximated by models with independence. Here we introduce a very general model of an inhomogeneous random graph with (conditional) independence between the edges, which scales so that the number of edges is linear in the number of vertices. This scaling corresponds to the p = c/n scaling for G(n,p) used to study the phase transition; also, it seems to be a property of many large real-world graphs. Our model includes as special cases many models previously studied. We show that, under one very weak assumption (that the expected number of edges is “what it should be”), many properties of the model can be determined, in particular the critical point of the phase transition, and the size of the giant component above the transition. We do this by relating our random graphs to branching processes, which are much easier to analyze. We also consider other properties of the model, showing, for example, that when there is a giant component, it is “stable”: for a typical random graph, no matter how we add or delete o(n) edges, the size of the giant component does not change by more than o(n). © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A key driver of evolvability is the widespread modularity of biological networks—their organization as functional, sparsely connected subunits—but there is no consensus regarding why modularity itself evolved. Although most hypotheses assume indirect selection for evolvability, here we demonstrate that the ubiquitous, direct selection pressure to reduce the cost of connections between network nodes causes the emergence of modular networks. Computational evolution experiments with selection pressures to maximize network performance and minimize connection costs yield networks that are significantly more modular and more evolvable than control experiments that only select for performance. These results will catalyse research in numerous disciplines, such as neuroscience and genetics, and enhance our ability to harness evolution for engineering purposes.},

	abstract = {Whether by virtue of being prepared in a slowly relaxing, high-free energy initial condition, or because they are constantly dissipating energy absorbed from a strong external drive, many systems subject to thermal fluctuations are not expected to behave in the way they would at thermal equilibrium. Rather, the probability of finding such a system in a given microscopic arrangement may deviate strongly from the Boltzmann distribution, raising the question of whether thermodynamics still has anything to tell us about which arrangements are the most likely to be observed. In this work, we build on past results governing nonequilibrium thermodynamics and define a generalized Helmholtz free energy that exactly delineates the various factors that quantitatively contribute to the relative probabilities of different outcomes in far-from-equilibrium stochastic dynamics. By applying this expression to the analysis of two examples—namely, a particle hopping in an oscillating energy landscape and a population composed of two types of exponentially growing self-replicators—we illustrate a simple relationship between outcome-likelihood and dissipative history. In closing, we discuss the possible relevance of such a thermodynamic principle for our understanding of self-organization in complex systems, paying particular attention to a possible analogy to the way evolutionary adaptations emerge in living things.},

Drawing on case studies from engineering-inspired approaches in biology we show how optimality analysis, and other design-related methods, play a specific methodological role that is tangential to the study of adaptation. To account for the role of these reasoning strategies in contemporary biology, we therefore suggest a reevaluation of the connection between design thinking and adaptationism.},

Using a cross-genome comparison, we show that (a) the older a protein, the better connected it is, and (b) the number of interactions a protein gains during its evolution is proportional to its connectivity. Therefore, preferential attachment governs the protein network evolution. Evolutionary mechanisms leading to such preference and some implications are discussed.},

Despite a decade of extensive studies, network reconstruction remains an outstanding challenge. The fundamental limitations governing which properties of the interaction matrix (e.g. adjacency pattern, sign pattern or degree sequence) can be inferred from given temporal data of individual nodes remain unknown. Here, we rigorously derive the necessary conditions to reconstruct any property of the interaction matrix. Counterintuitively, we find that reconstructing any property of the interaction matrix is generically as difficult as reconstructing the interaction matrix itself, requiring equally informative temporal data. Revealing these fundamental limitations sheds light on the design of better network reconstruction algorithms that offer practical improvements over existing methods.},

At equal quality, this map is ∼30\% larger than what is available from small-scale studies published in the literature in the last few decades. While currently available information is highly biased and only covers a relatively small portion of the proteome, our systematic map appears strikingly more homogeneous, revealing a “broader” human interactome network than currently appreciated. The map also uncovers significant interconnectivity between known and candidate cancer gene products, providing unbiased evidence for an expanded functional cancer landscape, while demonstrating how high-quality interactome models will help “connect the dots” of the genomic revolution.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing has a crucial role in the generation of biological complexity, and its misregulation is often involved in human disease. Here we describe the assembly of a ‘splicing code’, which uses combinations of hundreds of RNA features to predict tissue-dependent changes in alternative splicing for thousands of exons. The code determines new classes of splicing patterns, identifies distinct regulatory programs in different tissues, and identifies mutation-verified regulatory sequences. Widespread regulatory strategies are revealed, including the use of unexpectedly large combinations of features, the establishment of low exon inclusion levels that are overcome by features in specific tissues, the appearance of features deeper into introns than previously appreciated, and the modulation of splice variant levels by transcript structure characteristics. The code detected a class of exons whose inclusion silences expression in adult tissues by activating nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay, but whose exclusion promotes expression during embryogenesis. The code facilitates the discovery and detailed characterization of regulated alternative splicing events on a genome-wide scale. View full text},

Not only can it be solved in pseudo-polynomial time, but also decades of algorithmic improvements have made it possible to solve nearly all standard instances from the literature. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of all recent exact solution approaches, and to show that the knapsack problem still is hard to solve for these algorithms for a variety of new test problems. These problems are constructed either by using standard benchmark instances with larger coefficients, or by introducing new classes of instances for which most upper bounds perform badly. The first group of problems challenge the dynamic programming algorithms while the other group of problems are focused towards branch-and-bound algorithms. Numerous computational experiments with all recent state-of-the-art codes are used to show that (KP) is still difficult to solve for a wide number of problems. One could say that the previous benchmark tests were limited to a few highly structured instances, which do not show the full characteristics of knapsack problems.},

Through a new empirical quality control framework, we show that the resulting data set (Worm Interactome 2007, or WI-2007) was similar in quality to low-throughput data curated from the literature. We filtered previous interaction data sets and integrated them with WI-2007 to generate a high-confidence consolidated map (Worm Interactome version 8, or WI8). This work allowed us to estimate the size of the worm interactome at ∼116,000 interactions.

	abstract = {Current yeast interactome network maps contain several hundred molecular complexes with limited and somewhat controversial representation of direct binary interactions. We carried out a comparative quality assessment of current yeast interactome data sets, demonstrating that high-throughput yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening provides high-quality binary interaction information. Because a large fraction of the yeast binary interactome remains to be mapped, we developed an empirically controlled mapping framework to produce a “second-generation” high-quality, high-throughput Y2H data set covering ∼20\% of all yeast binary interactions. Both Y2H and affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP/MS) data are of equally high quality but of a fundamentally different and complementary nature, resulting in networks with different topological and biological properties. Compared to co-complex interactome models, this binary map is enriched for transient signaling interactions and intercomplex connections with a highly significant clustering between essential proteins. Rather than correlating with essentiality, protein connectivity correlates with genetic pleiotropy. Comparison of existing methods for mapping protein-protein interactions in yeast cells shows that the high-throughput approaches are complementary to one another.

	abstract = {Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is of fundamental importance to numerous biological processes. Nowadays, an increasing amount of gene regulatory relationships have been documented in various databases and literature. However, to more efficiently exploit such knowledge for biomedical research and applications, it is necessary to construct a genome-wide regulatory network database to integrate the information on gene regulatory relationships that are widely scattered in many different places. Therefore, in this work, we build a knowledge-based database, named ‘RegNetwork’, of gene regulatory networks for human and mouse by collecting and integrating the documented regulatory interactions among transcription factors (TFs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and target genes from 25 selected databases. Moreover, we also inferred and incorporated potential regulatory relationships based on transcription factor binding site (TFBS) motifs into RegNetwork. As a result, RegNetwork contains a comprehensive set of experimentally observed or predicted transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory relationships, and the database framework is flexibly designed for potential extensions to include gene regulatory networks for other organisms in the future. Based on RegNetwork, we characterized the statistical and topological properties of genome-wide regulatory networks for human and mouse, we also extracted and interpreted simple yet important network motifs that involve the interplays between TF-miRNA and their targets. In summary, RegNetwork provides an integrated resource on the prior information for gene regulatory relationships, and it enables us to further investigate context-specific transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory interactions based on domain-specific experimental data.Database URL : http://www.regnetworkweb.org},

To this end, large and complex networks of molecular interactions are being rapidly generated for humans and model organisms. A recent focus of bioinformatics research has been to integrate these networks with each other and with diverse molecular profiles to identify sets of molecules and interactions that participate in a common biological function — that is, 'modules'. Here, we classify such integrative approaches into four broad categories, describe their bioinformatic principles and review their applications.},

	abstract = {If you use p=0.05 to suggest that you have made a discovery, you will be wrong at least 30\% of the time. If, as is often the case, experiments are underpowered, you will be wrong most of the time. This conclusion is demonstrated from several points of view. First, tree diagrams which show the close analogy with the screening test problem. Similar conclusions are drawn by repeated simulations of t-tests. These mimic what is done in real life, which makes the results more persuasive. The simulation method is used also to evaluate the extent to which effect sizes are over-estimated, especially in underpowered experiments. A script is supplied to allow the reader to do simulations themselves, with numbers appropriate for their own work. It is concluded that if you wish to keep your false discovery rate below 5\%, you need to use a three-sigma rule, or to insist on p≤0.001. And never use the word ‘significant’.},
