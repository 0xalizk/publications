%\subsubsection{Scalability}\label{size_physio_context}

We considered whether the model can scale to larger networks
by allowing the simulation to continue until the simulated network's size is equal to 
that of the real network, in contrast to previously described simulations which terminated when networks' size reached 
400 nodes (Figures \ref{adap_fig} and \ref{evol_figure}). 
We performed three experiments in which the simulated networks were allowed to grow to a size
equal to that of Bacteria, Worm, or Bacteria Regulatory networks (see Table \ref{networks_summary} for their corresponding number of nodes/edges). 
The three experiments show the scalability of the model to larger networks, with the latter further showing its scalability to 
the regulatory context (as opposed to all other networks which represent protein-protein interactions). 
Figure \ref{large_PPI}  shows the degree distribution of the 
the fittest network after multiple generations of mutate-and-select. The number of generations is approximately equal to that of the number
of nodes in the corresponding BN. In contrast to the smaller-sized evolved networks depicted in Figure \ref{evol_figure}, 
the larger simulation networks shown in Figure \ref{large_PPI} show an even smoother distribution particularly of hubs of degree $\geq$10.

				Scaling to larger networks and applicability to different physiological contexts. Networks start empty and undergo reassign-edge, add-node, 
				add-edge mutations. Evolving networks grow by adding a node each generation while maintaining the same edge:node ratio as 
				their corresponding real BN. The simulation terminates when networks reach the same number of nodes as that of the corresponding real BN. 
				The final 
				degree distribution of the fittest network is illustrated (horizontal black dashes) against the experimentally validated 
				network (vertical colored dashes). The model scales well to the full Bacteria (left), Worm (middle), and Bacteria Regulatory (right) networks. 
				Simulating against Bacteria Regulatory network,  which is comprised of TF-Gene and TF-TF interactions as opposed to all 
				other networks which are comprised of protein-protein interactions,  further shows the applicability  of the model to different physiological contexts.
